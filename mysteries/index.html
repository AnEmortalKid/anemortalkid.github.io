</tr><tr>
<td>The Hungry Book</td>

No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Enigma of the Evil Eye</td>
<td> The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Problem of the Pants that Walked</td>
<td> The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Puzzle of the Pupils</td>
<td> The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Quandary of the Queue</td>
<td> While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Question of the Queen's Betrothal</td>
<td> The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious. The party are sought out by one of the castle's kitchen maids, who was away from the town caring for her dying father on the night the engagement was announced. When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Riddle of the Raider's Ship</td>
<td> The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders, mysterious transported onto the chalk downs. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Secret of the Sauce</td>
<td> After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish. If asked why it is so good, the innkeeper's wife (also the cook) will only say that it's all thanks to her secret sauce. There is nothing magical about the food.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tree of Justice</td>
<td> There's a single grave outside town, beneath a tree, the hanging tree. The grave the only person from town to ever commit a murder in the town's history. But now every morning, a new member of town is hanging from the tree......</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>The Very Heavy Box</td>

</tr><tr>

Soon after that, the monsters are shadows, but can be looked at directly, then they start killing.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hide and Squeak</td>
<td> All the rats in the city have mysteriously vanished. This seemed a good thing, until piles of dead rat-bitten cats were found last month, and the cities food stores have begun depleting at an unexplainable rate.

When travellers pass by they will always see a warm, orange light coming through a window and smell a mouthwatering smell of freshly cooked supper wafting towards them. The lady of the house, whose husband will likely be home late today, will always welcome weary travellers, offering them a place by the hearth, a wonderful meal and a soft bed for the night. All who go to sleep in the hut will wake up the next morning in rotten, lice-infested sheets in the wooden ruins of something that must have been a home many, many years ago, the decaying and brittle skeleton of whoever once lived here still lying on the muddy floor by the hearth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Quiet Village</td>
<td> This tiny village is contained within wooden palisade walls, ending at two usually open gates at the front and back. No sound can be heard from the village, and once you pass through its gates, no sound can be heard at all. A pan banging next to your ear is as silent as anything could ever be. This effect exists only within these wooden walls, and none of the townsfolk seem to notice.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Sea of Dirt</td>
<td> This empty town is devoid of life, but all its buildings and items remain intact. By day, it's a spot where a traveler can rest his weary head in a featherbed once belonging to some noble, or find a treasure of some kind that a blacksmith had tucked away. By night, the ground changes. Living things that touch the ground fall into it like a stone into water, and no amount of swimming can save them; they are pulled down into the unknown. The buildings are away from one another, making it hard to get from place to place. The town will not let you leave without a fight.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Missing Parents</td>
<td> There are no adults in this village. The kids rule in their place, and though they do not do the things that adults would do, they seem to be surviving fine. Nearby towns have not reported any of their adults coming to them, nor has anyone seen a sign from them. The only clue you have to go on is the ferocity by which the children protect the town hall's basement...</td>

<td> In the woods there sits a black stone, dark as night, and large as ten men on each other's shoulders. On the plateau of this rock stands ten people in a circle, old and young, men and women, and of different races. They do not acknowledge the presence of any who disturb them, and cannot be moved from the spot they stand in. In the center of their circle sits a second black stone in the shape of an egg. As day night falls and day breaks, they are unchanged. Now, though, there are only nine.</td>

<td>The Mad Hatter</td>
<td> At a local haberdashery, a hatter creates works that astonish and amaze even the most sophisticated of hat enthusiasts. No matter what price he sells them for, people fight to be the one to buy them. What seems odd, though, is the faint magical aura on each hat that nobody else seems to see. What caught your attention was that the aura felt a lot like an undead...</td>

<td>The Monk in the Field</td>
<td> In the middle of this field sits a monk, whose strong powers can be felt a mile away. There is nothing but grass around him on all sides but one; in front of him sits a forest. This monk is engaged in heavy prayer, a ritual perhaps, and cannot move or speak. From his tattered cloths and the growth around him it appears he's been at this for a very long time, years maybe, sustained by some otherworldly force. All you know is, the more you look at the forest, the heavier you feel, and the more inclined you feel to stopping this man's prayers.</td>

<td> a simple beggar known as richie. People who come in contact often lose things, you could toss him a coin and find your earrings gone.

He still sits on the same corner every day, not a coin to his name, watched closely, called a beggar and a thief daily.</td>

This morning, the eye was in the same corner and a ghost was rifling through his desk.</td>

When someone left a purse with her name on it containing a severed ear, she panicked.</td>

But come night, all of the citizens retreat inside and board their doors and windows. Come night, the undead come.

Upon further inspection, these undead look an awful lot like the exact citizens you were just talking to.</td>

<td>What do we find out there?</td>
<td> Last week, we made some resurrection and chosen one plot hooks, so it seems fitting that for this batch of mysteries we visit the supernatural and the strange. The plot hooks themselves suggest a way in which the story could move forward. In contrast, a mystery should lead the story astray. There need not be clear direction as to where a mystery may be heading. The mystery doesn't necessarily have to be solvable at all, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs. I'll post a few examples.</td>

Diamonds become turquoise become rubies become quartz; gold coins become coppers, which turn into platinum pieces. Trade becomes either impossible or completely possible; the more conservative merchants will close their doors to avoid being taken in, while the risk-takers will speculate and gather as many of the rapidly changing coins and jewels as possible. At the stroke of midnight, however, the transformations stop. Many a beggar has been made a rich man by the contents of his alms cup... and vice-versa.</td>

<td>The Invisible Boatmobile</td>
<td> Smack in the middle of a bustling town square is a place where nobody seems to walk--because there's a ship there.

The fact that it stands straight up while on land is a somewhat lesser miracle.</td>

<td> Tales tell that the king's daughter has the most beautiful golden hair. Tales are right; her hair is actually made of spun gold. Needless to say, she is kept under lock and key in the castle, and every ounce of shed or cut hair is whisked away to the treasury before you can say "exploitation."

The merchant offers you a sale of a wondrous item, then, whether you buy or no, will ride on, vanishing when you look away for a moment, although you can still hear the hooves of the horse. Bad luck comes to those who see the merchant; if they buy, the item will doom them, if they don't, they find themselves in a situation where only that item would have saved them. Some say there is something you can say to the merchant that will make them leave you in peace.</td>

After the confusion and gore of a pitched battle, who is to say that the strange tales told by the men and women who fought are not true? In a fantasy setting, some knights, sellswords, barbarian warriors, and common soldiers may forget most of the experience of a battle. But, sometimes, something will stick in the mind of one of these warriors, something unusual or out-of-place on the battlefield... The mystery doesn't necessarily have to be solvable at all, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs. I'll post a few examples.</td>

Fires were still burning. Swords and shields were still on their racks. Even the horses had disappeared. It seemed as if they had all vanished like a breath on the wind. The Count had hired a cabal of wizards to partake in the siege of Whitewalls and the men were wary of them. We don't like them lot who work for coin you see. They thought they'd break down the gate with their chanting and their rituals, and this whole campaign would have be over in a week if they had. But as they stood in their chalk circle mumbling, one of the incanters dropped limp. Maybe it was a lucky arrow from the battlements, none of us saw it. But as soon as the man in robes hit the ground a shape wrapped in shadows rose from the circle. They tried to run, but that thing was faster. It gutted them all before vanishing. You should have seen the Count's face, not that we were cheering either I'll tell you that. I rushed towards the soldier, but as I struck him down, he wasn't there anymore. Instead there was my wife, my mace embedded in her skull. She was holding little Callum in her arms. I swear it, it's true, and just as true I ran away like the Seven Devils were chasing me.</td>

Nobody ever saw her they swore to me, but I know what I saw as clear as you lot standing in front of me.</td>

But never will I forget the day we stood against the Elves of Shinmaer with their slim curved swords, we laughed and taunted their troups and their leather laced armor. But they just ran at us, without a sound, and they danced between us on unheard music like leafs on the winds of winter, and they shredded and tore through our ranks leaving nothing in their wake but falling soldiers and red-stained grass. We won that day, but for no gold in the world would I do that again.</td>

A glowing circle appeared in the middle of the battlefield and a wizard, a halfling, an armored dwarf, and a half orc stepped through it. The wizard glanced around quickly before yelling "Whoa! Whoops! Hold on.." and pushing the other three back through the sparkling rift. The magical anomaly disappeared. I was so stunned I almost got my head taken off.</td>

But, at the start of the Gordinia Woods battle, he sheds all his armor til he's just standin' there nude with his sword in hand. He charged into the fray and came out soaked in blood but untouched and through his breeches back on. The other lads made fun of him, called him names, said the only reason he survived all those battles was the enemy hesitating at the sight of him long enough to get cut down. But I saw him fight at Kaylor plains ... that boy moved with unnatural speed and skill...</td>

We had been told to be on a lookout for a missing patrol, so naturally we were on edge. It was then, when the mists swirled before a low rise we saw it. An enormous beast, humanoid in posture, but a great goat head replaced what human features would be atop its broad shoulders. It bellowed at our patrol, and as it charged towards us, hefting a bloodied axe, I recognized the head of Rommel, my mothers cousin swinging on a belt tied to the beasts bulk, alongside members of the missing patrol. We never stood a chance, I survived only because I crawled into a ditch and hid, as my friends were torn apart.</td>

There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Then, in the middle of the fight, I thought I saw smoke. I wondered if their camp was afire, but it was off to the flanks, not behind their lines. The cloud grew and grew, until it blotted out the sun, and we were in the dark. Then the cloud came down, further and further. And then it was amongst us - and it was bats. Thousands and thousands and thousands. All flying around us, the whole battle. Then, just as quick, they flew away, leaving the sky blue again. Strangest thing.</td>

Called the commander, and he raised the alert, so we formed up and got ready to receive a charge. The torches came closer and closer until they broke cover - and there was nothing there. No torches, no people, just the lights. The lights passed through our lines. Right through us. Corporal Gripes says he heard their footsteps, and I swear I felt the heat from one of the torches, but not a man saw a thing but the lights.</td>

Ah, honoured master, there is a tale to chill the blood, even on a day like today where the heat bears down. The dogs of the Berber Emirate needed to be taught to respect their true masters, so the armies of the Calphate were mustered. I was a humble Captain, commanding a mere one hundred lancers. Ah, I know my form is no longer of the dashing warrior I once was. But once, I was lithe and strong, and pleasing to the eyes of many a young beauty. The curs sought to hide from our wrath near the Bone Hills, but we stole a march on them and had them before us. Beautiful country for a horseman, honoured master. Flat and wide and just begging for a glorious charge. And who were we to deny? Yes, Achmed, the dates! I always have dates for the noon meal! And some for my guest! But as we trotted forwards, a strange mist arose. Nothing have I seen like it in all my days. The mists came, and enveloped us all. We could still hear their barbarous war-cries, and so we continued. But when the mists lifted, the plains were empty. From all around us, the cries of the Berbers, but no sign of them could be seen. They shouted that they could not see us, that we were cowards who had fled them, but they were the ones who had vanished. And then I saw a terrible thing. Many have called me a liar for my tale, but may the Prophet (peace be upon him) strike me down should I give tongue to a falsehood. A hundred great chariots sped across the plains, faster than the swiftest horse. But no horses pulled these great metal chariots. No wheels I saw, just dust. And a great tube, like the trunk of an elephant held outstretched before them. And the tubes spat fire! With a crash like that of thunder! I felt the great roar pass through my very body, and my horse reared. I crashed to the earth, and when I looked up, I was amongst the Berber rabble one more. They had been mown down like wheat and were routing before us, so none took notice of my fall. I looked about, and saw nothing of the monstrous chariots. None of my men - brave warriors all - ever spoke of that day. We were honoured for our part in a great victory, although truth be told not one of us wet our blades. I see doubt in your eyes, honoured master, and yet I swear by all that is, and by the truth of the Book that all befell as I have told you.</td>

Marched with the King against his brother when he tried for the throne. It was a cold day, and the Prince's army had found us and gave battle. Messy fight it was, with all of us mixed up with each other, tough hand-to-hand work. And then the shadow came over us. I looked up - and saw wings spread as wide as a ships sails. Massive red bugger it was. Flew over us, and landed to the side of the battle. And then another, shining like a copper penny, flew down. And another, green like the treetops. Then one gold, one silver, one black as night. They perched all around the battle, like they was watching us, or guarding us or herding. I dunno. They just sat there. Then they roared, and it was like they were trying to tear the air apart with their voices. The din shook the air in my lungs. Were they shouting at us? Or at each other? I don't know. Then, they stopped. It was so silent. And then they few away. We looked at each other - King's men, Prince's men - and we went back to our lines. nobody wanted to fight any more that day.</td>

<td>The War Nobody Won</td>
<td> The war wasn't just bloody, it was horror made flesh. Five armies? Six? Who could tell, with the alliances breaking and binding and breaking again. A sea of death, where the waves could barely hear themselves speak. When the survivors woke, they woke to desolation. Generals and kings slain, homes burned, whole cities annihilated. There was no victor... and if there was, they never stepped forward to take command. All that remained was charred chaos and bodies. Nobody knows who finally put a stop to the fighting.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>La Victoire</td>
<td> "I survived every cavalry charge and archer barrage that they sent up to us on top of Carver Hill. And every time, I swear I saw that same soldier. I know, because of his eyes. Blue, like bits of glowing lightning. Every time, I killed him, but he kept coming back. Sometimes... sometimes I think he still might."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Oathbreaker</td>
<td> Fifteen years ago, he ran when he swore to fight, and his king paid the price. He refuses to defend himself, despite how far he fell to save himself. Unless... that wasn't the reason?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Plains of Glass</td>
<td> The prophet stood on the stony outcrop overlooking the battle, and held out one interdictory hand. I still remember the sound of screeching and shattering as our weapons turned to glass in our hands.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>For Nitka</td>
<td> Throughout all the variations of sound in the universe, there is a melody that, if played upon a certain instrument, tuned to a certain off-key, played at a certain pace, will kill everybody who listened to it from start to finish. The papers the song was written too are titled, "For Nitka," but whoever Nitka is or who the author of the composition was is of great mystery now. If you plug your ears while listening to the song, or should you begin listening to it too late or begin listening too early, then your life will be spared. The song has only been performed once, and that was at a piano recital in the mansion of the family who claimed that an ancestor of their wrote it. One who'd been listening but left to use the latrine returned just in time to hear the end of the song and witness as everybody, including the player, suddenly fell over dead. "It wasn't even that bad of a song," the survivor claimed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Pillars</td>
<td> There are only three forests in the world where you will find a clearing of trees, where atop stand seven white marble pillars arranged in a circle. The pillars have existed on that hilltop longer than anyone can remember and there are no records of its construction and no nation can confidently make claim. As to what the pillars were erected for is a mystery. There are no bones in the dirt and there are no bloodstains on the stone. There are no articles to be found anywhere in the area. There are no other structures within miles of the pillars, and there are no deliberate paths leading to them. Yet people still find the pillars to sleep there. People who sleep in the circle of the pillars always have lucid dreams, which some will try to interpret as prophetic. Ceremonies to invoke for accurate dreams have changed throughout the centuries, but the dreams are always vague and weird. Sometimes, however, once in a generation, there will be a person who sleeps in the center of the circle of pillars and will awake recounting to have wandered through a great library, reading books about lost nations and civilizations, then awaking with a perfect memory of the experience.</td>

<td>The Coward in the Cave</td>
<td> I was in my seventeenth it eighteenth year, I remember, when I was on the front lines for the first time. My mind was racing with the thoughts of my father and mother, and just before we marched, I broke formation. I ran and ran, until I came across a nearby cave. I ducked in there and hid for what seemed a half day. When I came out, though, the battlefield was spotless. The camps, I could see, had only just begun to be set up, as though I had gone back three days. I ran as fast as I could from there, back to my parents' homestead.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>War of the Woods</td>
<td> There used to be a keep wedged in a valley, near the the great river. One either side of the keep were great forests. One day, the sovereign ordered for the villagers to evacuate, fearing a great force would soon come to eradicate his people. The next month, the wildlife in the forest seemed to storm the the valley, and many who did not leave were caught in the mayhem. The survivors left as fast and fled as far as possible. Their stories say that the forest denizens were more interested in goring one another, and that the animals were painted in blue and red, like warring armies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thunderstruck</td>
<td> We were pinned. Trapped on the cliff, an army to the south, and the storming ocean to the north. With no way out, our commander had decided that we make out last stand there. We charged, ready to meet our gods. I saw the whites of the enemy's eyes, felt his hot breath in the cold rain. As I lunged forward with my pike, lightning struck in the center of the battlefield. The flash was so bright, all I could see for the next minute was white light and vague, spinning shapes. As I came to, every man in the opposing army had fallen dead, yet no man of ours had been touched. Something saved us that day; it stole our glory from us.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Battlefield Saint</td>
<td> It was going terribly. We had been inspired by our mighty and virtuous cause; every man was willing to die it. But everything that could go wrong did. Our standard bearer was struck down within minutes of first contact. The enemy had large mobile ballistas, and their vast swaths of archers rained arrows like a deadly hail. I myself remember the pain of an axe in my side, followed by a huge barista bolt piercing not only my chest, but also the chest of a fellow comrade behind me. Before I died, I only remember seeing a man in white standing atop the distant hill above the chaos. Then darkness. The next thing, I feel a warmth inside of me. I felt at peace. And I woke up, face down in the grass, black and red blood painted across the green canvas of the meadow. I looked at my injuries to find them missing, and searched the horizon back toward the hill. The figure in white was shining with brilliance, and I could feel my breath escape my lungs in awe. Then, with a flash of blue, a ring of energy burst across the landscape, and the figure vanished in a puff of smoke.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Behind the Dune</td>
<td> The sand i was standing on was damp and soaked with blood, suprisingly i saw no dead bodies. I prepared to cross the dune front of, but i wish i wouldnt have crossed it, because what i saw standing on top of that dune was strange and disturbing.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The humming oak tree</td>
<td> We were sitting around the camp fire preparing to rest for the night. When i suddenly saw something strange in the dark. It was a dim light moving rapidly in the dark. I tried to follow it but it vanished after several yards. When i tried find the location the light vanished i found an oak tree. Strangle there was coming a humming noise from inside the tree, i swung my handaxe at the tree and then a bright flash of light appeared.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Raising of the Fallen</td>
<td> The battle went well for us. We thought that victory was at hand. Then their necromancers started raising the fallen to fight anew. It's hard enough to fight a soldier who feels nor pain nor fear, but it became harder still when they started raising the fallen from among our own ranks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Battle of Ninegrave</td>
<td> The battle went well for us. We could see victory at hand, until their necromancers approached the front. The fallen began to rise. Dead-eyed and resolute they advanced. It's hard enough to fight against soldiers who feel neither pain nor fear, and harder still when the corpse you strike down was once a friend.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Shimmering Vale</td>
<td> I know not why it was called the Shimmering Vale. When we crossed through it the air tasted of ash and the wind kicked up dust devils at our feet. The horses died first. Then the men began to sicken. They withered, fluids would not take hold in them, yet they did not die. Pale and parched we had to leave them behind. As we slept they marched closer, moaning for water. As we fled they called out, pleading for mercy. As we weakened those who could not keep up were abandoned. I do not imagine the ends they met were dignified. They refused to lie beneath the ground. When the remnants of the company crested the mountains at the other end of the valley we did not stop. We did not talk of where we would go or what had happened. As one, we deserted. Some were captured and hung, but most returned home and have yet to leave. I know that I shan't.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Red Border</td>
<td> On the hills I stand, looking down upon the long line of ground stained red. The other nation stands across from us, staring down the same valley. It is now I remember his words.. "I saw my friends die, I saw my comrades fall, I saw the enemy defeated, and yet we were told to run. Everyday after I came back, looking for my friends, looking to make a grave. All I could find were their weapons and the ground, stained, soaking pure red. Fools. They can't see the omen, and won't leave the border be..."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Honorary Swordsmen who won't let the dead die</td>
<td> They all know her, in the middle of war she walks the battlefield without fear. Despite wanting for death, she is bound by her honor. The same honor that caused her to pick up her blade. When she locks swords with someone who can hold their own, their fight, their sounds cause those around them to quiet. As they stand in awe, the two warriors duel - an honorable duel. She tells them, "Duel me with fairness, if I lose I will grant you unquestionable power." "And if you win?" "Then pledge to me your service, in life and death." And so they duel. They say she has not lost, they know she still holds power they cannot dare approach. They all know her, when the battle is lost she walks forward on the battlefield without fear. As she stares down the armies, a comrade notices a weariness on her face. She draws her sword, and so springs forth from the ground the fallen that have lost to her. Each great warrior, all whom have pledged their service, in life, or death.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Will-o-Wisp's Call</td>
<td> The call of the wisp has always about on the battlefield, calling to the strays as a guide. That night though, before we could even fight, they took half the army with them without a sound.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Charm Plague</td>
<td> The whole of the army, each soldier, beginning at the front line and spreading out like fire in a field of dry grass, began to turn on their kinsmen. Brothers in arms, so many long years at each others sides, thick as thieves, now savagely eviscerating each other. A very clever wizard had toiled away in his workshop for many months devising this charm. It was an amendment to something known in arcane circles as Dominate Monster, commonly used to take command of a monsters mind and give it direction against it's will. The wizard had constructed a method by which the spell could cast itself. When a mind is charmed by this spell, the creature immediately turns to all in it's vicinity and casts the spell on them before turning ruthlessly aggressive and killing all in his sight. By this method the spell spreads virally throughout the army. The wizard, clever as he was, didn't not anticipate that the telepathic link between himself and the affected minds would be two-way. It can hardly be imagined the mental anguish and terror to which he succumbed as he felt one thousand minds worth of rage and regret.</td>
