</tr><tr>
<td>The Hungry Book</td>
<td> Attempting to write in this book is futile, as anything written in the tome slowly fades away, no matter how much ink is used, until it is blank again. Oh, and once it's done absorbing the ink it smacks its pages as if they were lips, quite a disconcerting sight.</td>

No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Enigma of the Evil Eye</td>
<td> The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Problem of the Pants that Walked</td>
<td> The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Puzzle of the Pupils</td>
<td> The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Quandary of the Queue</td>
<td> While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Question of the Queen's Betrothal</td>
<td> The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious. The party are sought out by one of the castle's kitchen maids, who was away from the town caring for her dying father on the night the engagement was announced. When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Riddle of the Raider's Ship</td>
<td> The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders, mysterious transported onto the chalk downs. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Secret of the Sauce</td>
<td> After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish. If asked why it is so good, the innkeeper's wife (also the cook) will only say that it's all thanks to her secret sauce. There is nothing magical about the food.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tree of Justice</td>
<td> There's a single grave outside town, beneath a tree, the hanging tree. The grave the only person from town to ever commit a murder in the town's history. But now every morning, a new member of town is hanging from the tree......</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Case of the Open Windows</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Faceless Mayor</td>
<td> Every one in town has met the mayor, but can't provide a single detail about their appearance. The locals joke about their leader's nondescript looks, but a few questions will make it apparent that their mayor is literally indescribable.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Very Heavy Box</td>
<td> As a merchant was driving his wagon through town last week, a box fell from it and landed in the middle of the road. The locals have tried moving the obstruction, but though it seems to be a normal wooden box, it can't be opened and can't be moved.</td>
</tr><tr>

He experiences weird nose bleeds, and occasionally, his eyes grow red for seemingly no reason.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>A lively dream</td>
<td> A village has suddenly started having bad dreams. They all seem to be able to remember clips from their dream and it all has the same theme. Soon the dreams are exactly the same. Soon after that, the images are seen out of the corner of people's eyes, but disappear when looked at directly. Soon after that, the monsters are shadows, but can be looked at directly, then they start killing.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hide and Squeak</td>
<td> All the rats in the city have mysteriously vanished. This seemed a good thing, until piles of dead rat-bitten cats were found last month, and the cities food stores have begun depleting at an unexplainable rate. Last week all the former rat-killers vanished from their beds. And now, every night at the stroke of midnight, an eery otherworldly bell can be heard tolling from somewhere deep under the city.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Adventurer's Respite</td>
<td> There's a small hut on a hill besides the road, far away from any town or city. When travellers pass by they will always see a warm, orange light coming through a window and smell a mouthwatering smell of freshly cooked supper wafting towards them. The lady of the house, whose husband will likely be home late today, will always welcome weary travellers, offering them a place by the hearth, a wonderful meal and a soft bed for the night. All who go to sleep in the hut will wake up the next morning in rotten, lice-infested sheets in the wooden ruins of something that must have been a home many, many years ago, the decaying and brittle skeleton of whoever once lived here still lying on the muddy floor by the hearth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Quiet Village</td>
<td> This tiny village is contained within wooden palisade walls, ending at two usually open gates at the front and back. No sound can be heard from the village, and once you pass through its gates, no sound can be heard at all. A pan banging next to your ear is as silent as anything could ever be. This effect exists only within these wooden walls, and none of the townsfolk seem to notice.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Sea of Dirt</td>
<td> This empty town is devoid of life, but all its buildings and items remain intact. By day, it's a spot where a traveler can rest his weary head in a featherbed once belonging to some noble, or find a treasure of some kind that a blacksmith had tucked away. By night, the ground changes. Living things that touch the ground fall into it like a stone into water, and no amount of swimming can save them; they are pulled down into the unknown. The buildings are away from one another, making it hard to get from place to place. The town will not let you leave without a fight.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Missing Parents</td>
<td> There are no adults in this village. The kids rule in their place, and though they do not do the things that adults would do, they seem to be surviving fine. Nearby towns have not reported any of their adults coming to them, nor has anyone seen a sign from them. The only clue you have to go on is the ferocity by which the children protect the town hall's basement...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Liturgy to the Dead</td>
<td> In the woods there sits a black stone, dark as night, and large as ten men on each other's shoulders. On the plateau of this rock stands ten people in a circle, old and young, men and women, and of different races. They do not acknowledge the presence of any who disturb them, and cannot be moved from the spot they stand in. In the center of their circle sits a second black stone in the shape of an egg. As day night falls and day breaks, they are unchanged. Now, though, there are only nine.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Mad Hatter</td>
<td> At a local haberdashery, a hatter creates works that astonish and amaze even the most sophisticated of hat enthusiasts. No matter what price he sells them for, people fight to be the one to buy them. What seems odd, though, is the faint magical aura on each hat that nobody else seems to see. What caught your attention was that the aura felt a lot like an undead...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Monk in the Field</td>
<td> In the middle of this field sits a monk, whose strong powers can be felt a mile away. There is nothing but grass around him on all sides but one; in front of him sits a forest. This monk is engaged in heavy prayer, a ritual perhaps, and cannot move or speak. From his tattered cloths and the growth around him it appears he's been at this for a very long time, years maybe, sustained by some otherworldly force. All you know is, the more you look at the forest, the heavier you feel, and the more inclined you feel to stopping this man's prayers.</td>

He still sits on the same corner every day, not a coin to his name, watched closely, called a beggar and a thief daily.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The waypoint</td>
<td> A non-magical rock, often used by travellers as a waypoint due to it's recognisable shape. Although you're pretty sure it was standing in the woods last time you saw it, not in the middle of a corn field..</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The knocking</td>
<td> There are lots of tales of people dying peacefully in their sleep, with eyewitnesses saying the night before, the deceased got up and opened the door, reacting to a knock only they could hear.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>I Know That Guy!</td>
<td> Every inn or tavern in every town, village, or city the adventurers go to has a bartender that looks and sounds exactly alike. He always goes by a different name, but everyone in the party recognizes him from each of the other places. No matter how hard he is questioned or interrogated, he has no idea what the adventurers are talking about if they confront him with it.</td>

This morning, the eye was in the same corner and a ghost was rifling through his desk.</td>

<td> After a night like any other night, a well-known alehouse is broken into. The burglars managed to locate the hidden safe and crack it open.

When someone left a purse with her name on it containing a severed ear, she panicked.</td>

All the faces maintain the look of peaceful slumber. All except for the very last tree, which bears no leaves, it's branches ending in scorched limbs. The face on this trunk is frozen in a scream of anguish.</td>

<td>Citizens Watch</td>
<td> Lots of people come in and out of town on a regular basis, but there is always someone who, despite whatever else they have going on, stands at the gate and watches the horizon. This watch lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but the watchman/woman is hardly ever inconvenienced by taking this time. It is almost never the same person, rarely is it anyone who seems ready for combat, and they take their watch almost without missing a step, like they came to the city gate just to stand guard. No one ever speaks while on this watch, but they do pay attention to the events unfolding around them. Anyone touched or attacked immediately snaps out of this watch and is normally aware of whoever shook them from their watch. No one ever has a clear reason for why they are taking watch, just that "they thought they might have seen something"</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Quiet Town</td>
<td> Upon first glance, this is a completely normal village. The local people don't talk much, and stay away from strangers. But come night, all of the citizens retreat inside and board their doors and windows. Come night, the undead come. These undead don't seem violent, and don't attack the party, all they want is inside the houses. Upon further inspection, these undead look an awful lot like the exact citizens you were just talking to.</td>

It was said to have been built with an extinct magical kind of tree, and cannot be burned or easily broken.

The villagers claim many of their kind simply vanished and they are unable to leave the village grounds - they reappear on the other side when entering the nearby woods. The adventurers go to the nearby river past the tree-line and find an old dock with a shack and rowboat. Across the river is the exact same shack and boat, imperfections and all.

The 7th child is now 5 years old and looks identical to all the others. It also seems to remember the lives of its lost siblings.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>What do we find out there?</td>
<td> Last week, we made some resurrection and chosen one plot hooks, so it seems fitting that for this batch of mysteries we visit the supernatural and the strange. The plot hooks themselves suggest a way in which the story could move forward. In contrast, a mystery should lead the story astray. There need not be clear direction as to where a mystery may be heading. The mystery doesn't necessarily have to be solvable at all, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs. I'll post a few examples.</td>

There's just one problem: nobody has ever seen anyone deliver supplies to make the baked goods he sells.</td>

<td>The Day of Jubilee</td>
<td> For one day every fifty years, every piece of currency and every gemstone in the country begins to rapidly transmute itself. Diamonds become turquoise become rubies become quartz; gold coins become coppers, which turn into platinum pieces. Trade becomes either impossible or completely possible; the more conservative merchants will close their doors to avoid being taken in, while the risk-takers will speculate and gather as many of the rapidly changing coins and jewels as possible. At the stroke of midnight, however, the transformations stop. Many a beggar has been made a rich man by the contents of his alms cup... and vice-versa.</td>

<td>The Invisible Boatmobile</td>
<td> Smack in the middle of a bustling town square is a place where nobody seems to walk--because there's a ship there. At least, it feels like a ship; while one can feel the planks and grip the anchor chain, to all observing eyes, the thing is invisible. The fact that it stands straight up while on land is a somewhat lesser miracle.</td>

<td>Sister Goldenhair</td>
<td> Tales tell that the king's daughter has the most beautiful golden hair. Tales are right; her hair is actually made of spun gold. Needless to say, she is kept under lock and key in the castle, and every ounce of shed or cut hair is whisked away to the treasury before you can say "exploitation." One evening, a member of the party receives a letter by raven, pleading for rescue. There is no signature, but inside the folded paper are three strands of the finest gold.</td>

<td> Hrothman Togg is a pious man if there ever was one, and he keeps a clean establishment that caters to Clerics, Paladins, and other men (and occasionally women) of the cloth. Imagine his surprise when his daughter, a beautiful young woman, reveals that she's pregnant, and she doesn't know who the father is. Even more concerning to the community, however, is that up to a few days ago, Hrothman Togg didn't have a daughter.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Help</td>
<td> A wealthy baroness has accused her staff of stealing the silver, and the local guard has been called in to handle the matter. What starts as suspicion quickly becomes confusion when it becomes apparent that the entire staff - supposedly nearly three hundred people - is actually one man in a vast array of costumes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Plague of their Own</td>
<td> And now for the puns! When the local women's Turnipball team grows ill right before a big game, their coach (and manager) is at wit's end. After a truly inspired pep talk, he gets them onto the field... but within minutes both teams are doubled over in pain. Now most of the league is sick, and the men's teams are refusing to play.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>One Cue Over the Cuckoo's Nest</td>
<td> A small time hustler comes into possession of a staff that greatly increases his prowess in just about everything, especially billiards. Unfortunately for him, the staff is sentient, lawful good, and loudly repeats private conversations at the least convenient times.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chum Like it Hot</td>
<td> (Part of) a missing nobleman turns up at fishmonger's quay after a particularly large tuna disgorges his signet ring, still worn on a severed finger. The bereaved family requests it back, and after a short period of mourning, the nobleman's son is named as the head of the house. Spectators at the event can't help but notice that the son now sports six fingers on his right hand, one of which is sickly white, pale, and wears the family signet.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sleepless in Sea Cattle</td>
<td> A poleman on a garbage barge is swept into the river during a flash flood, and is saved by an aggregation of manatees. Now, several weeks later, he feels a strange urge to bathe in the brackish water of the bay, eat aquatic plant life, and headbutt boats. Even worse, his normally athletic physique is quickly becoming rotund, and his skin has become a rather unattractive gray.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Oh Danny</td>
<td> The moaning woman by the fountain that everyone walks past has a drawing of a young boy's face. It's her boy, Danny, and he's missing. Everyone has given up hope on finding him since he disappeared, but not her. This boy is everything to her, and now her husband, daughter, and best friend all won't speak to her anymore. Why?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hunter of the Wood</td>
<td> The Baron of these lands set a Hunter to the task of ridding hid hunting wood of a terrible thing that has killed those unfortunate enough to happen across it. Some are found with terrible teeth marks, others with wide, horrible gashes. Many are never seen again. And the Hunter has been gone for three weeks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lies We Tell Ourselves</td>
<td> The civil war between the Knights of this land and their forefathers, a paladinic order of tyrannical good, was only a Generation ago. But why can't anyone remember it clearly, or speak about it in detail? Do they fear plainly saying it, or have they really forgotten such a thing? How could they have naturally forgetten?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lost Battle</td>
<td> The PCs come across a recent battlefield. Long enough ago that most of the bodies are gone, but arms and armour still litter the ground. However, none of the locals know about any battle, there are no stories about it, and the coats of arms and banners are unknown in the area.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Boatman</td>
<td> Once a year a strange hooded figure poles a boat onto a certain dock. There is always one person who goes over to board it. Witnesses might say they looked afraid, relieved, or befuddled. The boat leaves, and that person is never seen again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Ghost Dragon</td>
<td> An apparition of a huge dragon appears whenever there is a lunar eclipse. It acts out the same scene each time - a titanic battle against an unseen foe. Finally it comes to rest at an abandoned plot of land where there are some ruins, and nothing grows.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Vagabond Merchant</td>
<td> There are stories of a merchant you meet on the road, with a covered wagon decorated in painted vines and scenes of frolicking pixies. The merchant offers you a sale of a wondrous item, then, whether you buy or no, will ride on, vanishing when you look away for a moment, although you can still hear the hooves of the horse. Bad luck comes to those who see the merchant; if they buy, the item will doom them, if they don't, they find themselves in a situation where only that item would have saved them. Some say there is something you can say to the merchant that will make them leave you in peace.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lost Prince</td>
<td> The Crown Prince has vanished from his rooms at the palace. Nobody saw him leave, and no divination has found a trace, either of him or foul play. The only thing left was an exotic rose not from this continent and a note saying "We must talk" in elegant handwriting.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Best Pies</td>
<td> The baker in town makes the best pies. The best. Everyone loves his pies. When people ask for his recipe, he just taps his nose and winks. Why are his pies so good?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>This Isn't Mine</td>
<td> One of the PCs wakes up one morning with a stone in their shoe. The stone turns out to be a flawless diamond, with the hint of something glinting in its depths. From time to time, people will come up to the PCs claiming the diamond is stolen, but when they see it they will go pale, give it back, and it isn't the diamond they were looking for.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blood Skies</td>
<td> The skies turn blood red one night, as if blood were flowing over the dome of the sky. Everyone is talking about it for months later, even monsters who would otherwise simply attack the party.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bunyip</td>
<td> The local children have a communal imaginary friend, it seems. The "Bunyip" lives in a local ox-bow lake, in a small piece of abandoned ground near the village. The Bunyip occasionally takes the children to his underwater house, they say, and gives them presents. The presents appear to be sea-shells, which is odd, given the sea is many miles away.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Maw</td>
<td> There is a local cave - not particularly mysterious until now. People used to shelter in it from the rain, or camp there when travelling to the next town. However, yesterday it suddenly changed into a carved likeness of an unknown monster with a huge, gaping maw. The locals would quite like the PCs to investigate.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tower In The Thicket</td>
<td> There is a forest of impenetrable Blood-Thorns. On dark moonless nights, what appears to be lights in a tower can be seen, about a mile into the thicket, on a hill.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Death Coins</td>
<td> Last night, all the portraits of the current king on all the coins of the realm changed to a hideous shrieking skull. Even the dies in the mint changed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Strange Harvest</td>
<td> The day before Harvest Day, one field in the village appears to harvest itself overnight. It's always a different field, and seems random. No matter how careful a guard is placed, one field is always harvested without anyone seeing how or who.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Draconic Surprise</td>
<td> Every dragon or draconic creature seems surprised to see one of the PCs. No matter what they were doing, as soon as they see that PC they will start, and look at them with astonishment. "It can't be..."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Blinking Signal</td>
<td> At noon everyday for one week of the year, a bright light can be seen blinking at the top of a cliff miles away. It looks like a reflection, but nobody knows what's causing it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sleep of Youth</td>
<td> At the same time every afternoon, every child in this small village becomes incredibly lethargic for ten minutes or so. It is possible to keep them awake, but they all try to sleep the duration. The town has grown used to the effect and treats it as part of daily life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Old Snarefoot</td>
<td> Deep in the woods, a creature is rumored to subsist entirely off of unwary travelers that it catches with its worn rope hands. According to the locals, there was an overzealous hangman many years ago, but no one knew what became of him when he was accused of treason.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Autumn Down</td>
<td> In the fall, trees in the King's Forest lose their leaves. Instead of standing bare, however, they grow fluffy grey down, then luxurious feathers as the winter progresses. It has been this way for centuries.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Snake Oil</td>
<td> Rekbar Otis is one of the land's greatest merchants. He has sold sand to camels, ice to vikings, and now, he's trying to con the good people of Randrenvale out of their gold with a miracle tincture. This time, it seems like it could be the real deal...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bard's Pass</td>
<td> None who come through the Bard's Pass, the only route between two mountain villages, emerge unchanged. Every living being that comes through the pass leaves with a newfound appreciation for music and a freshly tuned lute.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Spirals That Follow</td>
<td> Out of the blue, dark red spirals appear wherever the players are. They seem to be organic in nature, twitching, breathing, sometimes even screaming. Their sudden appearance only seems to be noticed by the players, though. The pillars seem to have a weird effect on townsfolk and other figures around though. Nobody seems to be willing to acknowledge their existence, even when interacting without. "Okay, so you're seeing the pillars, right?" "Yes." "And you're still saying they don't exist?" "... Yes"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Cave</td>
<td> Next to a small town there is a cave that leads deep, deep into the hills. What lays at it's very depths is unknown, however, as seemingly every twist and turn people make them end up outside again, leaving through the very entrance they came in through.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Element of Surprise</td>
<td> There is a cathedral where a mythical creature resides. Some say it's a living anvil, with teeth and a tongue that devour every adventure that nears, others claim it's a demon possessing the shadow of however enters, to kill it's owners. In all reality, it's a Suprise Elemental, a monster that without form, without reason. Only appearing when nobody is expecting it, always in the form that's least expected.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Siren Song of the Crypt</td>
<td> Rumors of hauntingly beautiful music carrying through the night have been cropping up around the town crypt. All of the townspeople who claim to have heard it seem happy to discuss their lovely new nighttime lullaby.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Fighters</td>
<td> Recently brawls at the local tavern have increased in their frequency and ferocity. People once known to be jovial, mellow, or sad drunks now turn on their friends with abandon at night. Curiously, people known to have a temple while drinking have now simmered down, and all involved seem unaffected during their daily lives, aside from nursing their fresh injuries.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Foresters' Plenty</td>
<td> The town's loggers refuse to travel more than a league into the forest, but the lumber they return with is far too dense to be young growth, and it burns with an unusual ferocity. They've been following the same logging trails for as long as anyone can remember, and refuse to show them to outsiders.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Circle of Feasting</td>
<td> The party happens upon a fairy ring in the forest. Since there are no actual Fey around, it seems to be simply a curiosity. Should anyone attempt to eat or drink within the circle, however, they will find that their food and drink has become cuisine fit for the most decadent of banquets. Upon leaving the circle, however, the food leaves a bitter, ashen taste in their mouths.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hills of Jars</td>
<td> Just under the rolling, grassy hills of Sucia Isle, a series of vast, labyrinthine warrens and warehouses waits. The stonework walls, ceilings, and floors appear to be ancient and caked with dust. Filling the tens and hundreds of rooms within the hills are large, earthenware jars, lined up by the thousands, their clay lids sealed with wax. The entrances and exits to these underground storehouses are warded with powerful glyphs, which have long since faded and gone dark with the ages.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Silence is Golden</td>
<td> This object is peculiar, taking the shape of a rolled ring of some strange, silvery material. At first glance, there is no immediate way to unroll it, but with adequate investigation, the end can be found, and the substance unrolled from the rest. The silver strips can be torn away with little effort, and will adhere to most dry surfaces, though they have no other effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tree of Runes</td>
<td> Deep beneath the earth, far removed from the most remote dwarven strongholds of the Shadowspire Mountains, there is a tree. Green and flourishing despite the lack of sun, the tree's roots reach deep and wide, breaking the cavern floor. Each of the tree's leaves bears a symbol that greatly resembles a rune in the Dwarven alphabet.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>New Tricks</td>
<td> While hunting in the deep forest, a Ranger's dire wolf companion has unearthed a fossilized femur bone of prodigious size that oozes dark red liquid when touched.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Treasure's Quandary</td>
<td> A collector's prize relic has been publicly proved a forgery, but that hasn't stopped a zealous cleric from demanding it be 'returned' to the temple from which it was 'stolen'.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ninety Lives</td>
<td> The neighbor's patch-furred, scarred old tom enjoys bringing the ravaged bodies of mice, rabbits and the occasional mimic spawnling to the steps of the outhouse, where the likelihood of meeting a bare foot in the middle of the night is at it's greatest. Lately, however, his prizes have included documents in foreign languages, gaudy jewelry, and the signet ring of a long-dead duke.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sideways Time</td>
<td> A Wizard of some renown claims to have (re)discovered a new school of magic, but is unwilling to disclose any more until someone can prove that he isn't dead.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Serpent's Feather</td>
<td> The snakes that nest in the barren cliffs that skirt the Northern edge of the great desert are renowned for the deadly potency of their venom, and have been milked for generations in semi-religious ceremonies by Kobold mystics, who then sell vials of the stuff to the highest bidder on the shadow market. Lately, however, various cells in the loose network of assassin's guilds have reported that the last shipment of venom isn't nearly as effective as it once was, and a few incredibly thorough practitioners of the murderous arts have been overheard suggesting that it might actually have restorative powers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Love the Bomb</td>
<td> In the quiet hamlet of Llywenshire, the well in the central square has served as the hub for the community for as long as anyone can remember. But after a sore-pocked and disease-ridden stranger clambered from its depths, shouting at anyone who would listen that 'SHE HAS AWOKEN' and 'THE END IS NIGH!', the villagers have begun to express concern.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bronze Candlestick</td>
<td> There is an old bronze candlestick on the mantle in the Rose Room at the Freewind Mage's Academy. Without fail, every morning, the caretaker finds the burnt stub of a candle in the bronze candlestick, even when there have been no guests in the Rose Room, and it has been locked all night. The caretaker has attempted to dispose of the bronze candlestick, but somehow it finds its way back to the room.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hopping Raven</td>
<td> Upon the gravestone of the beloved witch Lady Pinewall who succumbed to the blood plague, a raven hops up and down. When anyone approaches, the bird squawks "SPEARS!" and flies off, only to return once the coast is clear.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Golden Cherry</td>
<td> At the center of the Royal Gardens is an old cherry tree that produces wonderful, sweet red cherries. In the history of the tree, it has produced a golden cherry three times. The first time, the prince who picked and ate the cherry died in battle the following morning. The second time, the kitchen maid who picked and ate the cherry died of a bad belly. The third time, the stable boy who picked the cherry and fed it to the pigs fell to his death from a hay loft that very night.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Pig in the Chimney</td>
<td> At Garvil the Greenbeard's house, you'll hear an occasional squealing of a pig. The sound seems to be coming from his old stone chimney, but Garvil eats no meat and has never owned a pig. Sunny weather, stormy weather, crackling fire, or cold hearth, the squealing sound comes and goes as it pleases.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sun God's Feasthall</td>
<td> Way out in the desert in the ruins of the ancient city of Haz Alaf, there is a large stone table with stone benches still in its place in the feasthall of the Sun God. At noon on the day of the summer solstice every year, the table in the feasthall is filled with a traditional feastpears and dates, figs and lentils, roast fox, buzzard's soup, braised drake, camel's milk cheese, toasted crickets, fried scorpions, honeyed wine, and mild tea. Ever since the discovery of the miracle, hundreds of pilgrims make the dangerous journey to Haz Alaf every late spring to witness the miracle.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Black Castle</td>
<td> A black castle stands on the outskirts of a small town with strange customs regarding the dead, those that die are revered (think cattle in india). Word is the castle started out as nothing more than a pebble but has grown almost organically and they are willing to buy both the living and the dead for unknown reasons.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Circle of unhappiness</td>
<td> A round clearing in the middle of a vast forest. Nothing lay within, no grass, no trees, nothing but a single flower. Those entering will be faced with extreme dread and unhappiness to the point where they feel life no longer holds meaning for them. Even animals instinctively stay away.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jar of Many Faces</td>
<td> A clay pot sits on the shelf, the visage inscribed on the jar stares back at you with an angry grimace. When next you glance in the pot's direction, you notice it's no longer frowning at you, but grinning.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Many Moods</td>
<td> Embedded in this small golden band is a single gem. When unworn, the gem is a pearly white. When worn, the gem shifts to one of many colours, ranging from the palest blue to jet black.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Unfound Door</td>
<td> A door stands upright in the middle of a field, only visible from head-on. There is no frame or anything else to suggest it should be able to stand upright. When looked at from any other angle, it simply isn't there and may be passed through. The knob is locked and will not open for anyone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Boiling Bog</td>
<td> A large pool of water within a marsh is bubbling and boiling and steaming for no discernible reason. Strangely, the water is cool to the touch.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Well Of Black Water</td>
<td> This strange well sits atop a hill. The water within is clear and inviting, but once a bucket is dipped into the well, the water within is turned black as tar and greasy, utterly undrinkable.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Icebrick Tower</td>
<td> In the middle of the scorching wastelands stands a tower of shimmering clear ice carved into the form of bricks. No matter how hot it is out, the ice will never melt, even though it always seems to be shimmering with melt water.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Clear Circlet</td>
<td> In the Archbishop's parlor, on a mantle of dark wood, stands a circlet of beaten rose-gold. Across it stretches a translucent film similar to soapy water. Several of his guests have sworn they saw glimpses of strange lands, otherworldly places and in one case their own bedchamber inside it, but the Archbishop has never seen anything.</td>
