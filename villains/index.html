<tr>
	<td>Euryndas</td>
	<td> This guy is one of the sneakiest pieces of scum to ever hit the streets. But, the thing is, the guy didn't just win the streets, he's the puppet master that controls the king too. With a hand in the empire, he makes sure that his little gang can do whatever they want making him the wealthiest person in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ludik Russell Vansar</td>
	<td> A genius, blue-blooded human artificer and serial killer driven by only two desires: firstly, to create artificial, intelligent life. Secondly, a need to prove himself to an uncaring father. He is totally absorbed in his own problems and unfeeling; he sees other people as insignificant, and resources to be harvested. He suffers feverish nightmares that on the completion of his work, its first act will be to kill him. Yet these fatalistic dreams don't stop him - if anything, they seem to drive him on. More details available: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/2xrrpm/its_terrible_tuesday/cp3yfha</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Rupert Larrat</td>
	<td> A mortal man, Rupert Larrat is nevertheless one of the Succubus Queen Tulsami's more powerful lieutenants. He was corrupted by her and brought into her court centuries ago, and his soul nis now so twisted it is more like that of a fiend than a man. He has been promised Tulsami's wayward half-succubus daughter Raina, but is spurned by her. He is a swordsman no warrior should be keen to clash swords with: in his time he was one of the world's greatest duelists, and several hundred years full of practice and a great deal of practical experience have passed since then.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Tulsami</td>
	<td> A powerful Succubus, and a rival of Malchanthet for the title of Queen of the Succubi. Both claim the name within their home plane: while Malcanthet and her faction dwell in the Abyss, Tulsami and her followers call the Nine Hells home. Their rivalry is legendary, but Tulsami's ambitions extend far beyond this rivalry, as well as the politics of her own plane. Her succubi and incubi work to corrupt the residents of the material plane in a long-term plan that ends with her taking a realm of her own, and giving the succubi race a purpose in existence other than the work of other fiendish lords.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Shambles</td>
	<td> A group of downtrodden people have had their minds linked by some spell, these people function with a hive mind. The collective intelligence is enough to predict the future accurately, these groups may start with positive motives, but often devolve into evil schemes.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The pink rose assassins</td>
	<td> The members of this group are difficult to distinguish. The members dress as local knights often very convincingly. They will lead their targets to out of reach places, killing them with the weapons of knights. The nature of their façade often leads to questions weather they are just an excuse for murders done by knights. Many insist this group is very real, as they kill commoners and nobles alike.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The brown rag assassins</td>
	<td> Dressing as poor farmers and peasants, they only take jobs to kill many. Unlike most assassins they travel in groups just as peasants often do. They will kill off everyone in the building, they are usually hired to send a message rather than to remove an individual.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The noble politician dossier</td>
	<td> A wide spanning group of organised nobles usually of low standing. They affect political decisions en mass and are not above dirty tactics to get what they want. Occasionally they get one of their own to the top at which point the group tends to take commands from them. When a leader from their collective begins to do things for themselves the group tends to turn on them, often leading to assassination.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The God Hunters</td>
	<td> They do not kill people, but attempt to kill ideas. They have their own god and try to remove faith from others. Their methods vary but they do whatever they can to test the faith of others. Their methods include destroying religious artifacts, burning down places of worship, and openly denouncing other gods.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Roving Bear Man</td>
	<td> A strange man, with an odd fascination for bears, from brown bear cubs to owlbears. He is very unsociable but will behave mostly normal when human. When he takes the form of a bear he tends to steal all he can from small villages and takes them back to his small hut in the woods.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Raakar Longhouse</td>
	<td> An advisor to the king, only appointed recently. Raakar has a fascination with voodoo, this is not a hidden fact. His appearance is somewhat warped from his practice of voodoo. Many says he pulls the strings of the king, however the king is protective of him. As such many cannot question this.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Poynt Araderano</td>
	<td> An exceptionally stealthy assassin. Unlike most Poynt is not motivated by money, instead only desires a spectacle. He enjoys killing in front of a crowd using his signature needles, carefully piercing vital bloodlines and muscles.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Shelly Baker</td>
	<td> Corrupt, the one word to describe Shelly. While maintaining a near flawless public appearance despite the rumours, she pulls strings behind closed doors. Industrial espionage, assassination and sabotage. Nothing is too low, or immoral to keep her business right at the top. This is of course at the expense of the locals who are forced to pay her extortionate rates.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Red Woman</td>
	<td> A succubus would be considered evil on its own merit by some. The Red Woman is one of the oldest living of her species. Many say she has played a part in every major war in the last thousand years. Coercing kings and raising tensions. She did this because in times of war men are not picky of who spends the night with them, and her sisters have benefit from this greatly.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Lajixl</td>
	<td> Sahuagin wereshark priestess. She was afflicted with lycanthropy a few years back and has found a way to use it to her advantage. She is now in control of her tribe, and is working to manipulate (through terror and brute force) several other marine lifeforms (Koalinths, Merrow, & Kuo-Toa) into making massive attacks on local coastal cities.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Fanderful Winkletoes</td>
	<td> Gnome vampire. Fanderful was once a local hero, being a part of Graken's Crew, who are known for slaying an ancient blue dragon who terrorized the region. He disappeared ten years ago, and has returned to the local capital and has started working his way up through the political ranks. Many talk about how his temperament has changed drastically since his return, and how many of his old friends now fear him. Many of his political competitors disappear.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Shansa Fazel</td>
	<td> Human monk of Bane. At an early age, Shansa was forced into servitude to the Black Hand, a secret sect of monks who promote (enforce) Bane's worship. She is known for her exceptional cruelty in battle, and infamous for removing the eyes of those who refuse to convert to Bane, often while they are still alive.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Claw</td>
	<td> Elven rogue (assassin). None alive know his true name. He is the mysterious leader of the Ravens, the capital's thieves' guild. Very few encounter him directly, but his hand is in almost all the crime that happens in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Karl of the North</td>
	<td> Human barbarian king. Brutish barbarian king who united the six northern barbarian tribes five years ago after murdering all the previous clan chiefs. He is the epitome of a raging barbarian in battle, going berserk and killing dozens around him in one sweep of his great axe.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Faladorel</td>
	<td> Ancient shadow (bronze) dragon. Faladorel was once a noble, wise dragon, known councelor to the Elven Courts. Unfortunately, as has the same weakness as the rest of the good dragons' kind, and was corrupted by the Shadowfell. Over time, he grew darker and more malicious, and eventually took fully to the shadows. He is now the most fierce enemy of all the elven kingdoms, and instead of aid, offers only death and destruction to his once-allies.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>A'kin</td>
	<td> Mysterious owner of the local magic shop who always seems to know things he shouldn't or couldn't. Likes to give out magical baubles and trinkets to those who visit, but who knows what they do? Always polite and quick to ask about folks past, often using their names before he's given them. When asked about his past he'll reply "I'm merely a humble shopkeeper"</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Caldwell</td>
	<td> Caldwell is a master wizard who specializes in illusion-based magic and deception. He uses blackmail and other under-handed tricks to hold power over any of his allies and enemies, ensuring that he never has to fight anyone himself, while spreading his control as far a possible.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Alder</td>
	<td> A revenant who has his time limit magically suspended indefinitely. An enforcer who fears nothing, least of all death. He has the unique ability to disjoint any two things (especially bones) easily with the slightest touch, allowing him to cripple enemies and even disassemble weapons with ease.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Jimmy Chickenshack</td>
	<td> This fat piece of shit runs 4 whores out of the Leg & Whistle, real pigs, and uses the Lunk Brothers to protect himself, and his interests, which are many. He knows just about everyone south of the Gate, and rumor has it that he has connections to interests in the narcotic substances being smuggled out of the Evil Capitol, real heavy shit and expensive as hell, so they say. Jimmy likes to diddle gnomes when he can afford it, which isn't often, and he generally stinks of sour cheese and his own particular musk, which is not unlike rotting shit.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Bodiddle Blank</td>
	<td> This elven pimp runs a moderately-sized stable of whores from the top floor of the Come On Inn. His gaudy clothes and outlandish manner hide a crippling alcoholism, which makes him violent and unstable when any of his "Inner Truths" get violated. They include, "Pay on time", "Don't disrespect me", "Don't beg", and "Elves are the superior species". He walks with a sword-cane, with the pommel of a wolf's head, and can always be found down at the docks on 7th Day, gambling dice with whomever is stupid enough to play with him. He cheats, and well, and has a nose for knowing when to walk away. He hates and fears dogs.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Kerblaine Kersk-Obermeyer</td>
	<td> Gnomes have the quickest tongues, and his daddy taught him every dodge that the old man knew, raised him in the life, and fleecing a pigeon came as natural to him as breathing. Con-men don't last long who can't read the mood of a man, or a room, in a single glance, and violence is always the very last resort of a man who has forgotten how to use his wits. Kerblaine knows a hundred street cons, always playing the short-game, never sticking around, never appearing in the same street twice, if he can help it. His favorite dodge is to pretend to have found a lottery ticket in the street, but says he's lost his identification papers, and if the mark can go cash it for him, he'd split the winnings with him. Of course, the grifter can't let the pigeon just stroll away with a valuable ticket, so he asks for a portion of the future winnings, as a "security bond" (usually half, and Kerblaine generally forges tickets that pay off 50 gp, not too high to raise suspicion, and not too low as to not be worth the trouble). When the mark pays up and goes to cash in the ticket, Kerblaine disappears like smoke. Sometimes if the mark looks like he deserves it, Kerblaine will tip off the Watch about a potential con-man in the area, heading to the nearest Temple/Shrine of Luck with a phony ticket. He loves a drink and a dance with the ladies (or the men, he's not fussy), and never uses the same alias twice. He sleeps armed.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sunshine Perkins</td>
	<td> 7 feet of muscle and a mug slashed crossways with a blade, all turned to scar tissue. He moves fast when he needs to and is strong enough to lift a horse and carry it 30 feet. Human, late 20s, he rarely speaks, and does so with a deep, melofluous voice and a speech rough and uneducated. His favorite method of torture is carving off the victims eyelids and dislodging the eyes with a spoon, so they dangle, and can watch as the madman carves them up, into grotesqueries, starting with the feet and transforming their bodies into shreikingly horrific "works of art", as Sunshine thinks of them. That's just his hobby though. His job is mercenary, and works for a decent wage for most of the major gangs in the area, which one depends on his seasonal mood. His whims change with the sun, but he's generally loyal for the season if paid up and treated well, as his services are in high demand. His doesn't gamble or whore, but is known to drink heavily, preferring thick and bitter stout served in his triple-sized stein, whom he's named "Daisy".</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Elliot Cooper</td>
	<td> Known to his crew as the "Red Cube", he is one of a hundred who have led the notorious street gang, "Hermanos Perdidos", aka The HP, and he's been one of the lucky ones, strong enough to have consolidated his hold on the nearly 200 members of his brutal community. He is smart and cunning, known to favor rolling blood-red bone dice to make decisions, all just a ruse to make his enemies (and his friends) think he is reckless and unpredictable. In reality, the choices are already made and the dice are just theatre, but effective, and he likes to foster the impression that he is a servant of Fate. He is anything but. A ruthless warlord, who has been expanding his territory, wealth and security for the past 11 years, the second-longest serving "Los Primero" in the gang's 80-year history. Elliot is a middle-aged human, with bright red hair and a thick beard. He is tall and stocky with muscle. His favored weapons are two long daggers, named "Boo" and "Spooky", and his biggest weakness is a fondness for strong narcotics. He fears rats and snakes.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Devine Marco</td>
	<td> This old elven wizard controls an empire of assassins and thieves across half the continent. His spies are in every major city and his deep agents are close to a dozen high-ranking officials and people of influence. Completely bent on controlling the entire empire by the time he is 1000 is his life-long goal. A master of logistics, he has created a black-market trade economy that rivals the empire's legitimate one. A deeply intelligent man, his love of numbers and strategical, long-term ideals, have made him a force that the legitimate governments have begrudingly come to accept. His favored tactics against those who interfere with his business is to have one of his assassins administer a mild poison to the offender, who becomes sick with fever and excruciating cramps. After 3 days of this torturous illness the assassin terminates the victim and sends his head to Marco, to add to his collection (preserved in jars in a huge vault in his personal tower).</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Penny Mission</td>
	<td> Burglars are not hard to find if you know who to ask. Penny is not an ordinary burglar. She works for the government exclusively, and carries out missions against those who come into the possession of items that are deemed dangerous for that same government. She is devoutly loyal to this Grand Cause and is a raging patriot who has been forced to keep it to herself, and live a double-life. That second life is a studious book-seller, who is rarely seen except on 2nd and 7th Days, and only then for a few hours, and who keeps to herself and does not live beyond her means. Her specialites are gnomish and dwarven traplocks. She can get a Thunder Cutter lock (used on most of the front doors of the private estates she "visits") open in under 20 seconds, under 10 on a good day. She favors disarming traps to springing them, and has made a life-long study of the engineering habits of gnomes and dwarves especially, but has a working knowledge of other racial defenses as well. She loves to cook, and indulges that passion when forced into her book-seller role (a grey-haired wallflower named Erma Densmarsh who lets her 2 employees run the business, a small store called "The Fictional Fen" - a play on her name, and typical of the "cutesy" naming convention of the area). Her culinary skills are reserved primarily for human men. She spent many years being brutalized by them in various jails and prisons around the Realms and was once forced, by hunger, to partially eat a dead cellmate, a man who deserved so much more punishment than being snacked on.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Spell-force</td>
	<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a blueish glow. If hit with a spell, it duplicates that spell in another randomly chosen location within the room. This crystal automatically maintains concentration if needed. Spellforce can be directly damaged by non-magical attacks.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Crash</td>
	<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a orange glow. If hit with a melee attack, it deals that damage to everyone in the room (including the attacker). Crash can only be damaged from attacks which originate further than 15 feet of it.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Solr</td>
	<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a yellow-green glow. Solr has a faintly green-colored spherical field generated approximately 5 feet from it. If a projectile from a ranged attack comes closer than 5 feet of Solr, it is caught in Solr's field. Any creature who crosses Solr's field must succeed a dexterity saving throw or be hit by (some?) projectiles in it's field. Solr can only be damaged by Blunt or Force damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Niklas Edge (Ed)</td>
	<td> A cursed chef's knife that possesses it's owner. Ed just wants to live his life in peace, spending the rest of his time as a chef (or as the knife of a chef). His cursed status often brings paladins and clerics to his door as they attempt to destroy him. He's forced time and time again to 'eliminate' pesky investigators. He just wants to live in peace, dammit. Why can't you leave him alone?</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Princes Alice/Thieves' Guildmaster Reev</td>
	<td> The kingdom controls the military power, the thieves guild controls the money - Princess Alice controls them both. Her exact motives are obscured, but her supreme control of both powers allows her to continuously support her invasion of nearby states, only growing her might (and wealth) more and more with each victory.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Devout</td>
	<td> (Good for a horror/Shadowfell campaign) The Devout are powerful clerics and paladins who strongly believe that all who exist in your town are corrupted and twisted by the evil that surrounds it. They will not succumb to your obvious lies and your failed tricks. The Devout stop at nothing to eliminate the evil you represent.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Roregar</td>
	<td> The Roregar are a band of rangers cursed and tormented by their accidental trek into the outer planes. The Roregar have elongated features of their original race, and far, far paler skin. They now see every creature as a huntable beast, including innocent villagers and children. These monsters hate to be defeated by their 'prey' and will intentionally kill off severely wounded members of the party to preserve their hunter-prey dynamic.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Primary Lead Industrial Golem (PLIG)</td>
	<td> PLIG was a golem designed and used for an industrial project in which a grand city were to be built. Several wars later, the project lay abandoned and everything shut down... until an accidental encounter reactivates PLIG. PLIG, attempting to resume his task, begins building an army of Golems sent out to gather resources needed from wherever possible, including nearby towns and villages.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sigmund</td>
	<td> Sigmund is a powerful vampire who has spent much of his time building an army of followers. At this point, he has an entire village of followers. He often sends his followers on "trade" expeditions to bring in more people to capture and convert.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Weaver</td>
	<td> The weaver is an immortal spell-caster with immense control over residual magic. Each spell cast near her increases her spell-casting prowess. She believes that most mortals abuse the flow of magic and should be cut off from using it.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Blademaster</td>
	<td> The blademaster is a fierce warrior. Having honed his skill over the ages, he rarely misses attacks, making him a formidable foe in combat. When he attacks, roll d30s for the attack roll instead of d20s.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Gorgash</td>
	<td> Taken in by a pack of wolves when he was young, he never quite fit in. Sperating from his adopted family to try and find his birth parents led him on a life changing journey. He only found that his mother was killed at child birth, and his father killed himself shortly after trying to kill his only son by feeding him to the wolves. Gorgash now travels the country-side murdering new families in fear that the same thing will happen to them.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Fjord Horchok</td>
	<td> Grew up son of an innkeeper, didn't find his wizard potential until teenage years. Was shipped off to the college in the capital to become professional wizard. Was drafted to the military during the civil war, forced to kill hundreds of people. Now hunts after military officials to avenge the innocent people he killed.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Dealer</td>
	<td> Nobody knows his real name because he never reveals it. He hands cards of great power to people he feels have the capability to complete certain tasks (ie, rule over a group of people, kill your loved ones, make people think you're a god). He'll give many different people cards who will often "intersec" each other.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Fullerton Danglepants</td>
	<td> Wears unbelievably baggy pants. Has a wicked tattoo on his face of a owlbear. Runs a black market operation. Most famous for his sale of the illegal substance known as cool-juice.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Super McNasty</td>
	<td> Massively fat Dwarf with blindingly bright golden locks. Only speaks in rhyme and runs a criminal organization for bounty hunters called "The Groove".</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Hefley Swogginsson</td>
	<td> Notorious assassin. Has never been seen in person, but is feared for his signature technique, the Double Swoggin Swipe. His victims are always found without their eyes in their head, and their pants always no where to be seen.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Chucklenoggin</td>
	<td> Rumors of this once-paladin still linger around town. Many say that ol' chuckles' soul still haunts the graveyard to this day, forever calling out to end his suffering.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>That Damn Magpie</td>
	<td> It's a regular magpie with uncanny knack for pinching shiny items and avoiding arrows, bolts and stones. It's universally hated by everyone in town and many young men have tried to find it's nest, either to try and get back their stolen items or in hope of getting their hands on it's hoard. So far it managed to outsmart it's pursuers.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Yelong The Risen</td>
	<td> The once-dead Warlock who served Orcus, the demon lord. Yelong lead an army of undead in his attempt to conquer the world and crush the living via his mystical tablet, which could raise any who died as his thralls. In death the tablet was cast into the caverns below the earth and Yelong himself burned, however his dark master was not content to let him lie, and Orcus raised him from his ashes, combined with the essence of a demon servant. Now he dwells in the depths, seeking his tablet while trying to remain hidden from the world that destroyed him.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Julius Carellius</td>
	<td> Julius is a man of his time, highly intelligent and blessed with land and fortune from his noble family. With the conflicts of the past years abated somewhat he was free to pursue his desires: the study of magic, natural philosophy and archaeology along with unrestrained hedonism. This made him somewhat infamous, and as his senses dulled with each new pleasure he began to merge his studies with his pastimes and engage in depraved rituals of hideous nature. This all culminated in an incident in which his villa went silent, and from the doors emerged a wailing and screeching creature. The wight that was Julius is of unusually great power and terrorizes the local populace to this day.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Valaran the Doomsayer</td>
	<td> Valaran was a wandering prophet and though he achieved fame as a soothsayer to many he was an omen of doom. As it turns out the latter may have been more accurate, for Valaran was blessed by the Goddess of Time and used his extended life to become the world's most powerful Time Magus. With the flow of the ages in his grasp he became a mercurial wanderer, going from place to place and weaving fate as he went. When he was offended, or simply on a whim, he chose a new future for a person or place where calamity befell them. To defeat Valaran will not only require skill but subterfuge of an incredible nature, for if he knows you are coming you have already failed, and the wits to outdo a man who has seen the end and beginning of time itself.</td>
