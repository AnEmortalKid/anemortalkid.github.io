<tr>
<td>Euryndas</td>
<td> This guy is one of the sneakiest pieces of scum to ever hit the streets. But, the thing is, the guy didn't just win the streets, he's the puppet master that controls the king too. With a hand in the empire, he makes sure that his little gang can do whatever they want making him the wealthiest person in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>That Damn Magpie</td>
<td> It's a regular magpie with uncanny knack for pinching shiny items and avoiding arrows, bolts and stones. It's universally hated by everyone in town and many young men have tried to find it's nest, either to try and get back their stolen items or in hope of getting their hands on it's hoard. So far it managed to outsmart it's pursuers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Shambles</td>
<td> A group of downtrodden people have had their minds linked by some spell, these people function with a hive mind. The collective intelligence is enough to predict the future accurately, these groups may start with positive motives, but often devolve into evil schemes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The pink rose assassins</td>
<td> The members of this group are difficult to distinguish. The members dress as local knights often very convincingly. They will lead their targets to out of reach places, killing them with the weapons of knights. The nature of their façade often leads to questions weather they are just an excuse for murders done by knights. Many insist this group is very real, as they kill commoners and nobles alike.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The brown rag assassins</td>
<td> Dressing as poor farmers and peasants, they only take jobs to kill many. Unlike most assassins they travel in groups just as peasants often do. They will kill off everyone in the building, they are usually hired to send a message rather than to remove an individual.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The noble politician dossier</td>
<td> A wide spanning group of organised nobles usually of low standing. They affect political decisions en mass and are not above dirty tactics to get what they want. Occasionally they get one of their own to the top at which point the group tends to take commands from them. When a leader from their collective begins to do things for themselves the group tends to turn on them, often leading to assassination.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The God Hunters</td>
<td> They do not kill people, but attempt to kill ideas. They have their own god and try to remove faith from others. Their methods vary but they do whatever they can to test the faith of others. Their methods include destroying religious artifacts, burning down places of worship, and openly denouncing other gods.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Roving Bear Man</td>
<td> A strange man, with an odd fascination for bears, from brown bear cubs to owlbears. He is very unsociable but will behave mostly normal when human. When he takes the form of a bear he tends to steal all he can from small villages and takes them back to his small hut in the woods.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Raakar Longhouse</td>
<td> An advisor to the king, only appointed recently. Raakar has a fascination with voodoo, this is not a hidden fact. His appearance is somewhat warped from his practice of voodoo. Many says he pulls the strings of the king, however the king is protective of him. As such many cannot question this.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Poynt Araderano</td>
<td> An exceptionally stealthy assassin. Unlike most Poynt is not motivated by money, instead only desires a spectacle. He enjoys killing in front of a crowd using his signature needles, carefully piercing vital bloodlines and muscles.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shelly Baker</td>
<td> Corrupt, the one word to describe Shelly. While maintaining a near flawless public appearance despite the rumours, she pulls strings behind closed doors. Industrial espionage, assassination and sabotage. Nothing is too low, or immoral to keep her business right at the top. This is of course at the expense of the locals who are forced to pay her extortionate rates.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Red Woman</td>
<td> A succubus would be considered evil on its own merit by some. The Red Woman is one of the oldest living of her species. Many say she has played a part in every major war in the last thousand years. Coercing kings and raising tensions. She did this because in times of war men are not picky of who spends the night with them, and her sisters have benefit from this greatly.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Archmagister Yura</td>
<td> The leader of a hidden colony of an ancient, forgotten race. The Archmagister and his council are incensed when they learn of interlopers within the lands they consider their own. But it is not enough to drive off the settlers, for they want to retain their secret existence. If they force the settlers out, stories of them may be spread. If they kill them all, perhaps others will come looking. No, obviously the only solution is to wipe out everyone on the settler's own continent. To this end Archmagister Yura leads his people in the completion of the greatest and most terrible ritual ever performed: the Ritual of Undoing.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Callus Val</td>
<td> A ghoul warlock promised to the demon prince of undead, Orcus. Callus was once the king-in-waiting of the now ruined city state of Valhazar, where he still dwells. He heads the mockery of an undead kingdom from within his own family's ancestral tomb, deep in the heart of the city's catacombs. Callus was not a brave man when he was alive, and feared assassination attempts from his ambitious younger brother. He made a deal with Orcus for power over death, though he was not careful about the terms of his pact. A demon horde appeared to claim the souls of everyone in Valhazar, and those that were killed in the attack - including Callus - rose up as undead. Callus may have hoped to be brought back as a Lich, but Orcus has a sense of humour. Callus has the horrifying hunger of a ghoul. Yet he retains the intellect he had while living and has used it over centuries to amass equivalent knowledge and power to a lich - he even has managed to create his own phylactery. Callus intends to carve out an empire. The more mobile of his undead servants are sent abroad, for few living people willingly come near Valhazar these days. These undead raiding parties take as many prisoners as they can back to Callus. Some sate his ghoulish hunger, while others are slain and risen again as the newest recruits in his unliving army.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jorus Val</td>
<td> The younger brother of Callus Val, in life Jorus harboured ambitions for the throne of Valhazar and would gladly have assassinated his brother to claim it. His ambitions drove Callus to make the pact with Orcus that would bring ruin to Valhazar and it's people. Except for Jorus, who was acting as ambassador to a neighbouring nation and away from court at the time of the attack. Jorus' ambition did not abate. He seeks to reclaim and rebuild Valhazar, with himself on the throne. But since he can't do that until Callus and his horde are removed from the ruins, Jorus was forced to investigate how to extend his own life. He has since become a lich. He is attempting to amass a large enough mercenary force to make a foray into Valhazar and slay Callus and his lieutenants - killing the undead minions is not essential to his plan, indeed he would like as many of them to survive as is possible, so he can bind them to his own rule. and may therefore seek to contract powerful heroes. He hires them through a proxy, but if he is forced to meet any hero he presents himself as an archlich (a good-aligned lich), who seeks only to undo the evils of his brother.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ludik Russell Vansar</td>
<td> A genius, blue-blooded human artificer and serial killer driven by only two desires: firstly, to create artificial, intelligent life. Secondly, a need to prove himself to an uncaring father. He is totally absorbed in his own problems and unfeeling; he sees other people as insignificant, and resources to be harvested. He suffers feverish nightmares that on the completion of his work, its first act will be to kill him. Yet these fatalistic dreams don't stop him - if anything, they seem to drive him on. More details available: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/2xrrpm/its_terrible_tuesday/cp3yfha</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rupert Larrat</td>
<td> A mortal man, Rupert Larrat is nevertheless one of the Succubus Queen Tulsami's more powerful lieutenants. He was corrupted by her and brought into her court centuries ago, and his soul nis now so twisted it is more like that of a fiend than a man. He has been promised Tulsami's wayward half-succubus daughter Raina, but is spurned by her. He is a swordsman no warrior should be keen to clash swords with: in his time he was one of the world's greatest duelists, and several hundred years full of practice and a great deal of practical experience have passed since then.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tulsami</td>
<td> A powerful Succubus, and a rival of Malchanthet for the title of Queen of the Succubi. Both claim the name within their home plane: while Malcanthet and her faction dwell in the Abyss, Tulsami and her followers call the Nine Hells home. Their rivalry is legendary, but Tulsami's ambitions extend far beyond this rivalry, as well as the politics of her own plane. Her succubi and incubi work to corrupt the residents of the material plane in a long-term plan that ends with her taking a realm of her own, and giving the succubi race a purpose in existence other than the work of other fiendish lords.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lajixl</td>
<td> Sahuagin wereshark priestess. She was afflicted with lycanthropy a few years back and has found a way to use it to her advantage. She is now in control of her tribe, and is working to manipulate (through terror and brute force) several other marine lifeforms (Koalinths, Merrow, & Kuo-Toa) into making massive attacks on local coastal cities.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fanderful Winkletoes</td>
<td> Gnome vampire. Fanderful was once a local hero, being a part of Graken's Crew, who are known for slaying an ancient blue dragon who terrorized the region. He disappeared ten years ago, and has returned to the local capital and has started working his way up through the political ranks. Many talk about how his temperament has changed drastically since his return, and how many of his old friends now fear him. Many of his political competitors disappear.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shansa Fazel</td>
<td> Human monk of Bane. At an early age, Shansa was forced into servitude to the Black Hand, a secret sect of monks who promote (enforce) Bane's worship. She is known for her exceptional cruelty in battle, and infamous for removing the eyes of those who refuse to convert to Bane, often while they are still alive.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Claw</td>
<td> Elven rogue (assassin). None alive know his true name. He is the mysterious leader of the Ravens, the capital's thieves' guild. Very few encounter him directly, but his hand is in almost all the crime that happens in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Karl of the North</td>
<td> Human barbarian king. Brutish barbarian king who united the six northern barbarian tribes five years ago after murdering all the previous clan chiefs. He is the epitome of a raging barbarian in battle, going berserk and killing dozens around him in one sweep of his great axe.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Faladorel</td>
<td> Ancient shadow (bronze) dragon. Faladorel was once a noble, wise dragon, known councelor to the Elven Courts. Unfortunately, as has the same weakness as the rest of the good dragons' kind, and was corrupted by the Shadowfell. Over time, he grew darker and more malicious, and eventually took fully to the shadows. He is now the most fierce enemy of all the elven kingdoms, and instead of aid, offers only death and destruction to his once-allies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A'kin</td>
<td> Mysterious owner of the local magic shop who always seems to know things he shouldn't or couldn't. Likes to give out magical baubles and trinkets to those who visit, but who knows what they do? Always polite and quick to ask about folks past, often using their names before he's given them. When asked about his past he'll reply "I'm merely a humble shopkeeper"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spell-force</td>
<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a blueish glow. If hit with a spell, it duplicates that spell in another randomly chosen location within the room. This crystal automatically maintains concentration if needed. Spellforce can be directly damaged by non-magical attacks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Crash</td>
<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a orange glow. If hit with a melee attack, it deals that damage to everyone in the room (including the attacker). Crash can only be damaged from attacks which originate further than 15 feet of it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solr</td>
<td> This thing is a 2 foot across crystalline cube with a yellow-green glow. Solr has a faintly green-colored spherical field generated approximately 5 feet from it. If a projectile from a ranged attack comes closer than 5 feet of Solr, it is caught in Solr's field. Any creature who crosses Solr's field must succeed a dexterity saving throw or be hit by (some?) projectiles in it's field. Solr can only be damaged by Blunt or Force damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Niklas Edge (Ed)</td>
<td> A cursed chef's knife that possesses it's owner. Ed just wants to live his life in peace, spending the rest of his time as a chef (or as the knife of a chef). His cursed status often brings paladins and clerics to his door as they attempt to destroy him. He's forced time and time again to 'eliminate' pesky investigators. He just wants to live in peace, dammit. Why can't you leave him alone?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Princes Alice/Thieves' Guildmaster Reev</td>
<td> The kingdom controls the military power, the thieves guild controls the money - Princess Alice controls them both. Her exact motives are obscured, but her supreme control of both powers allows her to continuously support her invasion of nearby states, only growing her might (and wealth) more and more with each victory.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Devout</td>
<td> (Good for a horror/Shadowfell campaign) The Devout are powerful clerics and paladins who strongly believe that all who exist in your town are corrupted and twisted by the evil that surrounds it. They will not succumb to your obvious lies and your failed tricks. The Devout stop at nothing to eliminate the evil you represent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Roregar</td>
<td> The Roregar are a band of rangers cursed and tormented by their accidental trek into the outer planes. The Roregar have elongated features of their original race, and far, far paler skin. They now see every creature as a huntable beast, including innocent villagers and children. These monsters hate to be defeated by their 'prey' and will intentionally kill off severely wounded members of the party to preserve their hunter-prey dynamic.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Primary Lead Industrial Golem (PLIG)</td>
<td> PLIG was a golem designed and used for an industrial project in which a grand city were to be built. Several wars later, the project lay abandoned and everything shut down... until an accidental encounter reactivates PLIG. PLIG, attempting to resume his task, begins building an army of Golems sent out to gather resources needed from wherever possible, including nearby towns and villages.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sigmund</td>
<td> Sigmund is a powerful vampire who has spent much of his time building an army of followers. At this point, he has an entire village of followers. He often sends his followers on "trade" expeditions to bring in more people to capture and convert.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Weaver</td>
<td> The weaver is an immortal spell-caster with immense control over residual magic. Each spell cast near her increases her spell-casting prowess. She believes that most mortals abuse the flow of magic and should be cut off from using it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Blademaster</td>
<td> The blademaster is a fierce warrior. Having honed his skill over the ages, he rarely misses attacks, making him a formidable foe in combat. When he attacks, roll d30s for the attack roll instead of d20s.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jimmy Chickenshack</td>
<td> This fat piece of shit runs 4 whores out of the Leg & Whistle, real pigs, and uses the Lunk Brothers to protect himself, and his interests, which are many. He knows just about everyone south of the Gate, and rumor has it that he has connections to interests in the narcotic substances being smuggled out of the Evil Capitol, real heavy shit and expensive as hell, so they say. Jimmy likes to diddle gnomes when he can afford it, which isn't often, and he generally stinks of sour cheese and his own particular musk, which is not unlike rotting shit.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bodiddle Blank</td>
<td> This elven pimp runs a moderately-sized stable of whores from the top floor of the Come On Inn. His gaudy clothes and outlandish manner hide a crippling alcoholism, which makes him violent and unstable when any of his "Inner Truths" get violated. They include, "Pay on time", "Don't disrespect me", "Don't beg", and "Elves are the superior species". He walks with a sword-cane, with the pommel of a wolf's head, and can always be found down at the docks on 7th Day, gambling dice with whomever is stupid enough to play with him. He cheats, and well, and has a nose for knowing when to walk away. He hates and fears dogs.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kerblaine Kersk-Obermeyer</td>
<td> Gnomes have the quickest tongues, and his daddy taught him every dodge that the old man knew, raised him in the life, and fleecing a pigeon came as natural to him as breathing. Con-men don't last long who can't read the mood of a man, or a room, in a single glance, and violence is always the very last resort of a man who has forgotten how to use his wits. Kerblaine knows a hundred street cons, always playing the short-game, never sticking around, never appearing in the same street twice, if he can help it. His favorite dodge is to pretend to have found a lottery ticket in the street, but says he's lost his identification papers, and if the mark can go cash it for him, he'd split the winnings with him. Of course, the grifter can't let the pigeon just stroll away with a valuable ticket, so he asks for a portion of the future winnings, as a "security bond" (usually half, and Kerblaine generally forges tickets that pay off 50 gp, not too high to raise suspicion, and not too low as to not be worth the trouble). When the mark pays up and goes to cash in the ticket, Kerblaine disappears like smoke. Sometimes if the mark looks like he deserves it, Kerblaine will tip off the Watch about a potential con-man in the area, heading to the nearest Temple/Shrine of Luck with a phony ticket. He loves a drink and a dance with the ladies (or the men, he's not fussy), and never uses the same alias twice. He sleeps armed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sunshine Perkins</td>
<td> 7 feet of muscle and a mug slashed crossways with a blade, all turned to scar tissue. He moves fast when he needs to and is strong enough to lift a horse and carry it 30 feet. Human, late 20s, he rarely speaks, and does so with a deep, melofluous voice and a speech rough and uneducated. His favorite method of torture is carving off the victims eyelids and dislodging the eyes with a spoon, so they dangle, and can watch as the madman carves them up, into grotesqueries, starting with the feet and transforming their bodies into shreikingly horrific "works of art", as Sunshine thinks of them. That's just his hobby though. His job is mercenary, and works for a decent wage for most of the major gangs in the area, which one depends on his seasonal mood. His whims change with the sun, but he's generally loyal for the season if paid up and treated well, as his services are in high demand. His doesn't gamble or whore, but is known to drink heavily, preferring thick and bitter stout served in his triple-sized stein, whom he's named "Daisy".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Elliot Cooper</td>
<td> Known to his crew as the "Red Cube", he is one of a hundred who have led the notorious street gang, "Hermanos Perdidos", aka The HP, and he's been one of the lucky ones, strong enough to have consolidated his hold on the nearly 200 members of his brutal community. He is smart and cunning, known to favor rolling blood-red bone dice to make decisions, all just a ruse to make his enemies (and his friends) think he is reckless and unpredictable. In reality, the choices are already made and the dice are just theatre, but effective, and he likes to foster the impression that he is a servant of Fate. He is anything but. A ruthless warlord, who has been expanding his territory, wealth and security for the past 11 years, the second-longest serving "Los Primero" in the gang's 80-year history. Elliot is a middle-aged human, with bright red hair and a thick beard. He is tall and stocky with muscle. His favored weapons are two long daggers, named "Boo" and "Spooky", and his biggest weakness is a fondness for strong narcotics. He fears rats and snakes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Devine Marco</td>
<td> This old elven wizard controls an empire of assassins and thieves across half the continent. His spies are in every major city and his deep agents are close to a dozen high-ranking officials and people of influence. Completely bent on controlling the entire empire by the time he is 1000 is his life-long goal. A master of logistics, he has created a black-market trade economy that rivals the empire's legitimate one. A deeply intelligent man, his love of numbers and strategical, long-term ideals, have made him a force that the legitimate governments have begrudingly come to accept. His favored tactics against those who interfere with his business is to have one of his assassins administer a mild poison to the offender, who becomes sick with fever and excruciating cramps. After 3 days of this torturous illness the assassin terminates the victim and sends his head to Marco, to add to his collection (preserved in jars in a huge vault in his personal tower).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Penny Mission</td>
<td> Burglars are not hard to find if you know who to ask. Penny is not an ordinary burglar. She works for the government exclusively, and carries out missions against those who come into the possession of items that are deemed dangerous for that same government. She is devoutly loyal to this Grand Cause and is a raging patriot who has been forced to keep it to herself, and live a double-life. That second life is a studious book-seller, who is rarely seen except on 2nd and 7th Days, and only then for a few hours, and who keeps to herself and does not live beyond her means. Her specialites are gnomish and dwarven traplocks. She can get a Thunder Cutter lock (used on most of the front doors of the private estates she "visits") open in under 20 seconds, under 10 on a good day. She favors disarming traps to springing them, and has made a life-long study of the engineering habits of gnomes and dwarves especially, but has a working knowledge of other racial defenses as well. She loves to cook, and indulges that passion when forced into her book-seller role (a grey-haired wallflower named Erma Densmarsh who lets her 2 employees run the business, a small store called "The Fictional Fen" - a play on her name, and typical of the "cutesy" naming convention of the area). Her culinary skills are reserved primarily for human men. She spent many years being brutalized by them in various jails and prisons around the Realms and was once forced, by hunger, to partially eat a dead cellmate, a man who deserved so much more punishment than being snacked on.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Famous Hippopotamus</td>
<td> A hippopotamus who waded into the wrong mud pool as a child and was endowed with phenomenal magic and superior intelligence. His family were also so affected, but were slain by hunters. He was saved only because he revealed his freakish intellect before he could be killed, and was instead sold to a travelling circus. Here he became world famous for his performing tricks, and it was at the circus he met the fortune teller Razoo who started him on his journey of magical discovery. Eventually his knowledge grew great enough that he could escape his cage and run away from the zoo. Walking upright like a man and concealing himself under a cloak, Famous Hippopotamus was able to pass himself off as a larger humanoid, like a goliath or half-ogre. He lives on the fringes of society and has become the leader of a dark guild. His minions steal for him whatever scraps of magical knowledge they can find, and he grows ever more powerful. One day, Famous Hippopotamus intends to reveal himself and enact a grand scheme to make humanity pay for the things their kind have made him suffer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Caldwell</td>
<td> Caldwell is a master wizard who specializes in illusion-based magic and deception. He uses blackmail and other under-handed tricks to hold power over any of his allies and enemies, ensuring that he never has to fight anyone himself, while spreading his control as far a possible.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Alder</td>
<td> A revenant who has his time limit magically suspended indefinitely. An enforcer who fears nothing, least of all death. He has the unique ability to disjoint any two things (especially bones) easily with the slightest touch, allowing him to cripple enemies and even disassemble weapons with ease.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mother Magdela Rimedragon</td>
<td> Formerly the mother superior of a convent dedicated to an excessively unfun sun god, she was turned to evil and madness by a dethroned divine tyrant. Her nunnery is still outwardly all stiff and good, but every sister has been converted and nothing stays dead for long in the catacombs. Anyone seeking to do her in will be met with nary a magic missile or crossbow bolt; she is polite, first and foremost, and will calmly question and chide any interlopers in her sanctum (while a scentless poison gas to which she is immune builds to a lethal level in the ventless chamber).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lord Naples, Sr.</td>
<td> Creaking in the termite-ridden rocking chair he insisted on being buried with, the late Lord Conrad Naples, Sr fumes over the incompetence of his only son, who is no doubt spuriously wasting the family wealth, not to mention definitely not watering the lilies twice a week, and would it hurt to wear that shirt his mother bought him? Kept in check by layers of holy circles, booby traps, and elemental guardians, Conrad nonetheless draws adventurers to his aid through his vast mental powers. Any that survive the hurdles of his prison will be offered the task of killing Naples, Jr, for which they will be repaid with a sack of copper pieces and a swift kick in the rear, because in my day you had to kill ten men if you wanted an egg for breakfast, and damn if you didn't earn it, not like kids these days.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chef Sargossa</td>
<td> Sargossa makes her living touring the world, cooking extravagant dinners for the rich and dim-witted. Her reputation precedes her, and makes a potent weapon against her hated aristocrat patrons. Signature dishes include unicorn steak, gelatinous scoops, and soup like your mother would make. Few complain, when doing so reveals how unrefined one's palette is. She might be encountered as the chef at a privileged estate, serving drider eggs benedict, or collecting unwilling ingredients.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Assistant Vice-Associate of Artifact Requisitions, Cuthbert St. Rufterfrangle</td>
<td> Cuthbert needs things done by the book, and he IS the book. NOTHING must be out of place and EVERYTHING must be accounted for, on paper, signed and stamped by at least three witnesses. Adventurers? The bane of his existence. They never fill out their forms right, and for every two hours of paperwork they give him he's going to give them two days of waiting around for their next assignment or paycheck. Oh, you forgot your requisition papers? Maybe he'll "forget" about that dragon that is guarding the location of your next mcguffin...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stitches</td>
<td> Stitches was made by the Millers on a lazy summer evening about 15 years ago. Billy got the stuffing, Mary did the sewing, the Twins helped find the best sticks for his body, and when it was done Ma helped draw on the face and Pa set it up in the fields to help protect their autumn crops. Then a wandering hag found her way to the sleepy farmstead. Stitches awoke with a deep gnawing desire to be human and a hatred of all things living. Now he wanders the dark moors of the land looking for fresh body parts to stuff into his sewing and skin to tighten his rotting fabric. His face remains, bloodstained, with the happy upwards smile in blue and black poster paint.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Big Boss Bo Bartrand</td>
<td> The Big Boss is king of the undercity, the underground. He has his fingers in all the pies and he pulls all the strings. No matter what con you're running, the Big Boss gets his cut or you will GET cut. He has a wealth of information, available for the right price. He can get you into the right places, for the right price. Money gets you access to everything, but don't get the wrong idea, Big Boss Bartrand still owns everything. This is his city, and if you even think about crossing him you'll be sleepin' with the fishes by morning.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Remarkable Five, Adventurers for Hire!</td>
<td> Consisting of a Dwarf Fighter, Elven Ranger, Half-Orc Barbarian, Halfling Rogue, and Human Wizard, these adventurers are the talk of the town! Their deeds are legendary, their prices reasonable, and their hearts are pure. Sure, they accidentally murdered that village instead of helping them. Sure, they attacked and killed that one paladin because the fighter wanted his +2 magic sword. Okay, sure instead of negotiating peace with the goblin tribe they slaughtered them all to the last man and looted their corpses- but they are DEFINITELY not the bad guys and there DEFINITELY won't be ANY collateral damage if you hire them. Promise.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Prowler</td>
<td> The Prowler is a serial killer, either human or elf, who stalks the streets of <insert key campaign city here>. His identity is unknown but he wears a black trenchcoat, a mask (similar to that of Darth Nihilus), and is extremely skilled with a short sword and magic. Every 1d10 days he kills 1d4 people, mainly city guards, and raises them as zombies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ayllen of the House of Goldentree</td>
<td> Ayllen Goldentree is an elven noble woman living in <insert main city here>. While she is only a minor noble in theory, she exercises massive influence due to her network of spies and assassins. She knows the secrets of almost every noble in <insert country here>. She tries to contract the PCs to work for her. Not one to take no for an answer, if they refuse, she finds some sort of secret of the players to strong arm them into helping her.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Blackarrow Clan</td>
<td> More of a group of antagonists than a group of villains. The Blackarrow Clan is a clan famous for its bounty hunters. Lord Erroll Blackarrow is a human ranger, the current head of the clan, and the best bounty hunter in the land. The Blackarrow Clan’s signature weapon is the infamous black arrow, a secret family recipe for a black poison that is applied to the tip of an arrow (thus its name) which causes 2d6 poison damage along with unconsciousness in 1d10 turns. The idea is that if the PCs commit some sort of crime worthy of getting a bounty placed on their heads and the Blackarrow Clan comes after them.

<td>Avard the Starved and the Starving Army</td>
<td> Avard the Starved is a human who was once a wizard who experimented with ghouls and ghasts. He was ostracised after several “subjects” escaped from his lad and made a meal of a few townspeople. Furiously, he continued his experiments in the wilderness. After an experiment gone wrong, Avard was turned into a ghast/human hybrid but retained his spellcasting ability and the ability to command ghouls and other ghasts. Deciding to get revenge on the people who exiled him, he assembled an army of ghouls and ghasts that later became known as the Starving Army. Some of the ghasts he managed to teach magic and he taught them how to cast greater invisibility multiple times. Forming the ghouls into squads of five ghouls and one ghast, Avard then set them upon various cities and towns resulting in an increase in guards all over <insert main kingdom here> to protect the people from roving bands of invisible ghouls. OPTIONAL: Many criminals saw this and witnessed the power of Avard and approached him asking to be turned into ghast/human hybrids themselves. Avard obliged and made them the officers in his army.</td>

<td>The Severed (& The Skeleton Guild)</td>
<td> No one has seen this mysterious figure, but everyone is aware of the Skeleton Guild that follows them. Some form of necromancy has taken foot of the surrounding area, meaning that any body rendered down to a skeleton through whatever means is immediately animated as a "member" of the Skeleton Guild; a crazed construct bent on "liberating" other skeletons from their fleshy prisons. All signs point to one of the twelve Merchant Council members being The Severed though it remains to be seen which one it may be.</td>

<td>Grand Savage</td>
<td> The leader of the largest orcish clan in the unclaimed wilds has always earned the moniker of Grand Savage as a term of respect from all subordinates and rivals. The current title holder is an eccentric yet towering old orc with a penchant for wide brimmed hats and leopard skins, his weary eyes hidden behind a pair of darkened spectacles. His aim is to unite the clans through whatever means necessary and slaughter the settlers that dare encroach on (what he considers) the orcs' rightful holdings, just as he butchered his way to the top of the food chain.</td>

<td>Archivist T'veleroth</td>
<td> An ancient Mindflayer that had found itself sealed in an abandoned temple many centuries ago, T'veleroth swiftly lost his mind. With no food to prey upon and no way to escape he slowly became more deranged and desperate, eventually making a deal with whatever god or demon could ensure he survived his imprisonment. The deal was a success, but the cost was his free will; now he stalks the temple, enslaving the minds of others who dare enter to serve his dark lord and studying ways to bring his master's avatar into this world.</td>

<td>Lord Eldric var Malum</td>
<td> A minor lord with a glittering military career, he was charged with leading the assault on a valley that laid within contested territory; a task that many thought would be simple as the neighboring kingdom had few defenses positioned there. What instead occurred was a decade long guerrilla campaign which led to heavy losses on both side. With mounting pressure from his superiors and news of enemy reinforcements approaching he set off a deadly arcane bomb that devastated the surrounding land, wiping out both sides, including his wife and child who were stationed at the army's base camp. As the only survivor he blames both his own empire and the enemy for what happened and now aims to ascend to the throne, bring retribution against all he considers guilty and find a way to bring his family back from the dead by any means necessary.</td>

Gorgash now travels the country-side murdering new families in fear that the same thing will happen to them.</td>

<td> Julius is a man of his time, highly intelligent and blessed with land and fortune from his noble family. With the conflicts of the past years abated somewhat he was free to pursue his desires: the study of magic, natural philosophy and archaeology along with unrestrained hedonism. This made him somewhat infamous, and as his senses dulled with each new pleasure he began to merge his studies with his pastimes and engage in depraved rituals of hideous nature. This all culminated in an incident in which his villa went silent, and from the doors emerged a wailing and screeching creature. The wight that was Julius is of unusually great power and terrorizes the local populace to this day.</td>

<td>Valaran the Doomsayer</td>
<td> Valaran was a wandering prophet and though he achieved fame as a soothsayer to many he was an omen of doom. As it turns out the latter may have been more accurate, for Valaran was blessed by the Goddess of Time and used his extended life to become the world's most powerful Time Magus. With the flow of the ages in his grasp he became a mercurial wanderer, going from place to place and weaving fate as he went. When he was offended, or simply on a whim, he chose a new future for a person or place where calamity befell them. To defeat Valaran will not only require skill but subterfuge of an incredible nature, for if he knows you are coming you have already failed, and the wits to outdo a man who has seen the end and beginning of time itself.</td>

He was a paladin, pure and devoted to the light who led a small part to reclaim the ancient temple in the jungle. He and his companions ended up trapped in the lower levels of the ruin: without food, without water, without light, and surrounded by an ancient demonic presence, they were driven to madness and cannibalism.</td>

They have more recently been spending gold to influence curriculum at various academies and universities and among the councils of nobles in several nations across the continent. They even sponsor acting troupes that move about the countryside performing tales in which the wealthy and powerful are champions over the forces of evil. They have thousands dependent on them for work, and hundreds dependent on them to maintain their illusion of power. They're playing the long game, but they're getting close to having the entire world under their thumbs (if it isn't already...).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Malspora</td>
<td> Malspora was once an elf-maid and druid of great beauty and power, though she has long-since forgotten her Elvish name. Long ago in her forest, she came upon a strange, tentacled fungus that called to her in sweet whispers. When she approached it, the fungus wrapped it's tentacles around her and held her captive for years. Slowly, the fungus changed her: it twisted her form, and poisoned her mind with ugly and terrifying thoughts. Then, after a time, the grasping tentacles released her. She now roams the world, spreading deadly spores. When a creature inhales the spore, its mind rots over the course of a few hours and then it dies, only to rise as a fungal zombie. These fungal zombies rove in bands, uprooting trees and plants and pummeling living creatures, leaving a trail of destruction and decay. When one of the fungal zombies is slain, spores erupt from its corpse, thus creating more fungal zombies. By some foul craft, Malapora's mind is preserved from the rot, and, though she can't command the fungal zombies, she's quite adept at avoiding them and leading them untouched territory. She has hopes of creating a world where the body of every plant, beast, and humanoid has been reduced to a decaying mass for the cultivation of tentacled, malevolent fungus.</td>

<td>Evira Dath</td>
<td> A powerful mage who, long ago, sacrificed herself for the good of her people: she voluntarily became a lich so that she had access to the power to save the kingdom from an invading goblin force. She was convinced that the purity of her mission could keep her from straying into evil -- and indeed she succeeded in turning back the goblins, through the use of necromancy and foul diseases. Her mission fulfilled, she fled, undying, into the remote mountains in an attempt to spare others from her evil deeds. However, over the intervening centuries, her transformation has corrupted and embittered her, and she seeks to take revenge upon those she blames for her transformation; the kingdom she once called home.</td>

Indeed, he will hire groups of heroes to venture into such places to secure them before the thieves get to them! He has an affable and genial manner, with a distinctive speech impediment, but this is a facade: in actual fact, he is to blame for the thefts (his concern is an act), and is seeking a particular long-lost dark artefact, for the power it can give, and to complete a certain ritual...</td>

He created us, fabrications for his sick whimsy. Every moment of your adventure since you came together, every ally and foe, every challenge you have overcome, has been naught but a game of chance.

She takes delight in tempting souls to gluttony and over-indulgence just so she can take things away when it suits her. She enjoys screaming and beautiful music, particularly tragic songs of death and sadness. Her sadism is only outstripped by her ambition, and the safest course of action with Melika is to avoid her schemes altogether.</td>

He rules over a small domain known as the Blood Pits where he personally torments many of the souls he collects. Scholars attribute the Tragedy of King Berend to madness, but many superstitious Northerners believe that Gujerikk's scheming had a part in the horrific tale. Many of these claimants have been haunted by dreams of their loved ones suffering in a place that matches the only known description of the Blood Pits.</td>

<td> Gobbluth is a tall, handsome fiend, with a winning smile and neatly kept dark hair. He's not physically impressive, but he carries himself with confidence, and he thinks you should be impressed by his every word and every illusion he creates. Relying on his wicked good looks and his talent for illusions, Gobbluth's steadily seducing his way up the hierarchy in the Hells, and has made it as far as being a minor attendant in infernal high court. Perhaps, "minor attendant" is a stretch—he's a squatter. He snuck into the court and spends most of his time hidden in a large cupboard in the kitchens, slipping out to work his tricks on the low-ranking, female-identifying members of the court.</td>

Still, his presence is feared by the wee - many a pixie has come home to find their family pinned to a hawthorn branch, their wings scattered in the underbrush below. He appears to mortals as a small bird, with grasping, long fingered hands where his feet ought to be, and his song is said to give mild indigestion to the young and weak at heart.</td>

Then it sends the father on a suicide mission to help further its plans and rid itself of a loose end.

He's become a popular entity to some, as tributes to him are made by trading and selling magical artifacts with adventurers. Gold that ends up in his followers possession causes his power to swell, and his favorite treasures all hold some deep connection to his realm. He schemes to draw the holders of his artifacts to the realm of Abracadabra, where he hopes to pit them against each other in a battle royale for amusement and coin.</td>

<td>Fzar H'kat, the last necrophore</td>
<td> Fzar H'kat has always felt anger and ressentment for dragons, which had slaughtered most of his race several thousand years ago. The necrophore used to be one of the most powerful empire on the land and ruled with an iron fist, until they declared war to the emerald dragons. Necrophores are thought by most to be just a myth, as they haven't been seen aboveground in a long while. These cunning creatures have a distinctly creepy physique, with twenty long spider-like black legs under a green reptilian torso. Their small white eyes aren't of much use and they instead rely on their bat-like ears to navigate the tunnels where they live. A few decades ago, Fzar's village was found by a scout of the emerald dragons and subsequently destroyed. Everyone in his community was murdered, including him. Fortunately for him, he was a fervent cleric of one of the gods of death, which granted him a new life and some powerful necromancy abilities. In exchange, he has to garner 200,000 souls before dying again, or his own soul will be sent to the shadow realm and locked forever.</td>

They have the savage cruelty of their mother but the cunning wits of their father, as well as a thirst for adventure that not a lot of goblins usually have. They look distinctively goblin, except for their orange hair which comes from their father. Quwip is the biggest and meanest one of the bunch, a large muscled half-goblin wielding two small waraxes and ruthlessly cutting down anything in his path. His fellow half-brothers and half-sisters are just as dangerous as he his and include talented sorcerers, agile thieves and battle-crazed barbarians. They managed to tame a pack of worgs which they use as mount.</td>

He wanders the land, searching for wealth and glory to eventually build his own empire and army in order to take back the kingdom that he believes is his. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and would gladly kill any number of innocent lives if it could bring him a step closer to his throne. He would probably sell his soul to Lucifer himself in exchange for his throne.</td>

<td>Juliet, the kyton mother</td>
<td> Killed during a particularly painful sacrifice, Juliet's soul was taken by the devils of the darkest depth of hell, where she became a deformed and monstrous kyton. In time, she ended up becoming a remarkably mean devil herself, gaining pleasure in causing as well as receiving pain. She eventually amassed a cult of devilish followers and even sent some expeditions back in the mortal realms to bring back new corpses and souls. A group of paladin came down to her realm to stop her after one too many expedition and although they eliminated a good bunch of her followers, she eventually defeated them all. Before consuming their soul, she forced herself on the leader of the paladins' team, which resulted 9 months later in a kyton-spawn tiefling. She loved her son so much and it broke one of her hearts when he fled to the mortal realms at age 13. She has been searching for him ever since, sending devil spies behind him in the world of men. She will stop at nothing to bring him back in order to give him the punishment that he deserve, no matter how many souls she has to destroy in her path.</td>

<td> Ghelia can take many form in our world and every single of them cause mishief. She walks the land in search of lives to ruin. Either by destroying crops, reputation, marriages, companies, guilds or kingdoms, she strives to destroy everyone's joy in life and reason to live. She has been doing it for so long that she doesn't even remember why and she doesn't even take pleasure from doing it anymore. She simply does it because it's what she has always done. She hasn't been back in Hell for so long that she doesn't even remember what her true form looks like.</td>

<td>Bashkatet, also known as Hilderoy the cruel</td>
<td> Hilderoy is the name of his human form. A bearded man with an eyepatch and a wooden leg, Hilderoy leads an armada of pirates that show no mercy and enjoy throwing people down at the "sharks". But Hilderoy is not human. His true form ressemble a enormous lamprey with twelve pairs of fins, that can stick his mouth to the bottom of a ship and wreck it from below. An army of smaller similar demons follow his ships along and wait patiently for the corpses of their master's fallen ennemies to be thrown from the side of the boat. If you see Hilderoy's flag approaching, abandoning your ship and jumping into the water is probably the worst thing you can do, for a quick death by sword is preferable to being eaten alive.</td>

<td> A first glance at Nurilla would give off her vaguely humanoid form, however, a closer inspection would betray her shimmering snake-like lower body. Don't look too closely though, her beautiful face is framed by a writhing mass of snapping snakes and an off-glance in her direction could be enough to turn you to stone. A freak of nature, her nest lays in the center of a garden of petrified victims. She lives in constant pain, laying clutches upon clutches of sickly, fragile eggs, which spawn chittering collections of colossal cockatrice. The nearby river is tainted with her infected influence, and the local settlements are constantly under siege by her oversized offspring.</td>

<td>The Beast of Brightmill</td>
<td> A seaside town, Brightmill's economy is heavily weighted in their fish market. However, a huge increase in missing persons cases have befallen the town as of late, and their economy has fallen into a depression as a result. A gargantuan Merrow, referred to as "The Beast of Brightmill" has been spotted on several occasions, lunging from the water's edge, and pulling people into the cloudy water. A well-fed creature, at nearly 15 feet long, many fisherman have lost their lives, trying foolishly to predict the Beast. The houses nearest the ocean have been abandoned, as huge claw marks line their doors and windows, and body parts won't stop washing up on the beach. Boats that are left near the docks are frequently missing, presumed to be either sunken or dragged off to sea by the creature. "The Beast" emanates an overwhelming aura of malicious intent, and some citizens see it as a punishment sent by the gods for the town's prosperity.</td>

Wherever mortals stand together, wherever common ground is found, wherever differences are put aside, Yissik will turn his gaze - and begin his plans. All too often they succeed as the mightiest of bonds may be broken by the simplest of whispers, if they fall in the right ears. His mortal form is fluid, though it remains simple and gregarious, full of the seeming of goodwill and bonhomie.</td>

<td>Grena Akssah</td>
<td> The primal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night can be traced back in history to Grena's more whimsical days. Grena is an Oni who stays out of the spotlight. He is the puppetmaster of the world. Pulling strings in courts, kingdoms and towns with no telling where his influence ends. Using his natural ability to shapeshift he gains access to the most powerful people in the land and gains their trust. The reason for his longevity is unknown though it is most likely due to the large sum of knowledge acquired over his time spent collecting artifacts and among the educated. The one thing he cannot hide with his shapeshifting is the eye of vecna that he has replaced one of his eyes with. Most if not all of his shapeshifted forms wears an eyepatch or similar way of masking it and they all tend to hum. Very few if any people can actually guess at his existence in the world however every child is taught the Oni's Rhyme: Lock the door, blow out the light; The hungry oni haunts the night. Hide and tremble, little one; The oni wants to have some fun.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Baroup, the Eternal Torturer</td>
<td> A being powerful enough to challenge Gods over dominance of the souls of the deceased, Baroup feeds with the pain and anguish he inflicts on the souls he snatches before passing on to the afterlife. His pocket demiplane, The Prison, is a locked place of eternal torture, and anyone entering would be hard pressed to get out.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Und'Aliber, the Shadow in the Light</td>
<td> Und'Aliber is a being of pure darkness encased in a shell of light. Shining like a (fake) beacon of hope, it takes on the form of whatever its interlocutor desires the most. Und'Aliber takes extreme delight in tricking followers of the Path of Light into taking evil actions, while still appealing to their sense of "justice" or "honour".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Miasmus, The Creeping Hunger</td>
<td> Appearing often as an attractive tiefling wreathed in a cloud of grasping purple fumes, Miasmus breaks the mold of most demons. Not content with other demons' blind madness, the Creeping Hunger is driven and focused by his demonic desires. He plans and schemes like the best of devils, but ever the rage and hunger lingers beneath, cresting to the surface when things don't go his way. Of particular interest to him is answering the call of warlocks seeking a pact with devils. When he presents himself as such, he provides maddeningly complex contracts and asks for little in return for access to his power, masquerading as the lawful entities the warlock has planned for. However, he devotes himself to twisting the warlock's goals to base consumption and destruction, culminating in the eventual ruin of the warlock and the acquisition of many souls for Miasmus.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Krul, the Revenant</td>
<td> "Rest, it never comes...." Once a proud warrior of the realm, he led the charge against a powerful lich in his own fortress. Krul destroyed the lich's phylactery, but took the lich's cursed greatsword through his chest as a result. Nobody could pull the weapon from Krul's corpse, and the curse bound Krul's soul to his decaying body. Now, centuries later, he seeks any means necessary to end his eternal suffering and get his long-deserved rest.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Balladar, the Infernal Seneschal</td>
<td> Diabolic Patron of courtly manners and intrigue, Balladar has agents in the most powerful kingdoms in the world, manipulating events behind the scenes. Not for any eventual goal, but for the simple joy of causing drama in the courts of kings. Backstabbing, secret deals, and lies are his domain, and whenever they are committed in the name of his worshipers, he gains power, no matter the goal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solzerik, the Whispering Shade</td>
<td> Solzerik is a petty demon, not powerful enough to be of any importance in the Abyss. He instead turns to petty murder, terrorizing villages and small towns. His true joy, however, is what comes after. Using illusions and other magic, Solzerik turns the townspeople against each other, eventually inciting riots and anarchy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The three breakers of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains</td>
<td> The breakers are three powerful demons who are the torture masters of the great demon halls. they are known far and wide for their malice and their horrible techniques</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Barluq Breaker of Body</td>
<td> One of the three breakers of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains, Barluq is called the body breaker because he enjoys not only defeating his opponents in battle, but utterly destroying them, he wields a massive greatclub with which the bodies of his victims crumble a sunder</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Garlrup Breaker of Spirit</td>
<td> The second Breaker of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains. as the second Breaker, Garlrups task is to break the spirit of his foes. he fights them, then raises them from the dead, then he fights them again, carefully making sure not to completely obliterate the bodies of his victims, the victims come back with weaker and weaker bodies. but the fight does not stop untill the victim has lost all hope and surrenders itself to the third breaker</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lady Grith Breaker of Mind</td>
<td> The third and final of the breakers, Lady Grith tears the victims mind to shreds, she uses her powerful illusion magic to create horrible scenarios in which her victims are forced to abandon all of their principles of not only moral code, but logic and reason as well. the victims will make choices so difficult and twisted that in the end, their mind will be forever broken by the powerful influence of shadow magic, infesting and corrupting their mind as they work their way through her maze of horror.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grazzab, the Lightdrinker</td>
<td> Grazzab is a Shadow Demon who detests all light as an unnatural corruption of the chaotic void in the depths of the Abyss. Grazzab traveled the Planes, hoping to snuff out all sources of Light, and made periodic trips to the Shadowfell to try and heighten its influence over the Prime worlds. Unfortunately for him, he was snared by an ambitious wizard who imprisoned him in an idol on a Prime World, but Grazzab had the last laugh when his counterstroke ripped the wizard's soul from his body and became an energy source that Grazzab uses to spread magical darkness that literally steals, or "drinks" the light from the surrounding area. The wizard's tower is now Grazzab's lair, and though he is imprisoned in the idol, his influence over the local area is significant, and he can manifest himself within the total darkness of the tower's confines. Unwary treasure hunters looking to steal the wizard's old loot find their sanity wrenched away if they're lucky; if they're unlucky, they join Grazzab's retinue as Shadows that help guard the idol housing the demon's essence.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chamdar, the Soul Binder</td>
<td> Chamdar is a Chain Devil who delights in tempting mortals into dark pacts and contracts, and then using said mortals for sadistic experiments into the nature of suffering and torment once the terms of the deal are up. Chamdar first began to exert influence over the Prime when a sorcerer in a war-torn country sought to keep his family safe from the fighting--in exchange for helping construct an arcane sanctuary, Chamdar wrenched away the sorcerer's soul and tormented his family mercilessly in the sanctuary, often using the sorcerer himself to inflict the torments. Every night, the sorcerer had his sanity ripped away and he murdered his family in cold blood, only to later be confronted with what he had done. However, due to the nature of the contract, each day his family is restored to life, their memories fully intact, but the sorcerer's recollections were wiped away. Chamdar delights in watching just how torturous the family relations have become.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thom, Fiend-Lord of the Ordinary</td>
<td> Wherever Thom appears, magic disappears. His fiendish nature sucks out the magic out of reality itself. Every spell with a duration just flickers and fades once he nears. Magical fires dim, animated golems break down, and enchanted swords become, well, just swords. Thom hates all that is out of his daily routine, which mainly consists of an ordinary peasant's routine, with no magic involved and he'll go to incredible lengths to make sure no one breaks his routine. Wizards, Warlocks and sorcerers beware.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nycrosh, Duke of the Dead</td>
<td> Nycrosh is a small-time God of Death, who lures the souls from dying villagers into his own pocket dimension. His dimension is small, and only attracts the souls of specific areas, but he aspires to be a great god of death. Sitting rotting and decaying in his throne of bones, Nycrosh tries to make his afterlife the only afterlife.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Unseen and The Unheard</td>
<td> Two fiendish brothers that respective dominion over the sense of sight and the sense of hearing. The Unseen can completely escape the eye, as if he was invisible, sneaking through busy streets unseen. The Unheard eludes the hearing, slithering through creeky mansions unheard. They're assassins for hire, but ask for more than just gold to complete their job.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sword of Rhaggash</td>
<td> Like many legendary swords, especially those stuck in rocks, the Sword of Rhaggash promises the wielder to be king. However, once someone removes it from it's stone seal, the sword's dark tendrils overtake the wielder and take it over as a host. Rhaggash, king of a kingdom long forgotten, takes over, and will stop at nothing before it reclaims it's long lost kingdom.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>U'rg, A'rg and I'rg, The Endless Debaters</td>
<td> U'rg, A'rg and I'rg are the three fiends with severly clashing personalities, inhabiting a demonic host.. U'rg is the enslaver, and dreams of enslaving entire realms to supply him with luxuries. In battle, he tends to charge the strongest of his foes first. A'rg is the murderer, and dreams of a realm with bleak burned trees covered in innocent blood. In battle he goes after the weakest opponenst first. I'rg is the peacekeeper, and would love for everyone to just get along, and not fight for once. In battle, he's defensive, and tries to come to diplomatic compromise. Only one of them can be in control at the time, and they randomly take over from each other. If you listen very closely, you can hear the three argueing eternally in their collective head.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Praelix, Fiend of Battle</td>
<td> All Devils have their own specialities and favourite targets for temptation, and for Praelix it is the battlefield that most readily draws him to the mortal plane. Unusually among the scholarly Phistophilus, Praelix loves to engage in discussions of strategy and tactics and will even don his custom leather armor (though best not to ask WHAT leather) and ride out on occasion. Some Diabolists consider Praelix's preference for claiming the souls of warriors to be a sign of intellectual weakness, a misapprehension Praelix himself readily encourages. Jovial and helpful, he affects the manners of a country gent - he even has a drawing room with weapons mounted on the wall. Each one is bloody and broken, and each is wrapped in a contract.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bizuloth, the Betrayer</td>
<td> Bizuloth, a powerful Archdevil, was imprisoned by Asmodeus for breaking an oath of service he made aeons ago. His once sharp wit and cunning intellect has decayed across millennia into a twisted mind bent upon the destruction of Asmodeus and all who have wronged him. Bizuloth's few remaining lesser devils seek those who could free their master and seek to make a deal for his release. Bizuloth, however, cannot be trusted, as he has lost his honor and any deals he makes are meant to be broken.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Al</td>
<td> With his entire race enslaved by shadow demons since he was young, the deep gnome Al had right to be jealous of the overworlders. After possession by a powerful "sympathetic" shadow demon, Tenebakalo, his new powers allow him to finally bring an end to the surface dwellers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tenebakalo</td>
<td> Possessing a weak deep gnome, the powerful shadow demon feigns sympathy with his cause to use him as a conduit for his powers, and allowing him to take reign of those on the surface. His ambitions will be his undoing.</td>
