<tbody><tr>
<td>Let's meet these soulmongers and destroyers!</td>
<td> Powerful demons and devils make excellent really bad guys. Fiendish villains can cloak themselves in complicated schemes, hide behind the flesh of a mortal, and act on impulses and desires that mortals cannot comprehend. I'll post a few examples (which may or may not have drawn inspiration from here).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Plyrr, the Shard</td>
<td> Plyrr dwells in the periphery of events, preferring to milk small travesties where others wreak terror on larger scales. Still, his presence is feared by the wee - many a pixie has come home to find their family pinned to a hawthorn branch, their wings scattered in the underbrush below. He appears to mortals as a small bird, with grasping, long fingered hands where his feet ought to be, and his song is said to give mild indigestion to the young and weak at heart.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sluuth, the Carrion Legate</td>
<td> Rare amongst Devils, Sluuth is an honorable foe, hewing closely to an ancient (and staggering complex) personal code that governs his every action. Even rarer - his legion is a mixed one, made up of fiends, awakened monsters, mortal races, fallen celestials and countless others. He is not to be trifled with, and has been known to put entire kingdoms to the sword to prove a point, honor notwithstanding.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hgrph, the Seamstress</td>
<td> The peak she guards is a lonely one, and she spends her long twilit days circling it on wings hewn from shards of ebon and flame. While most pass under her shadow unscathed, the unlucky few who catch her notice are rarely seen again. The hermits who dwell on the edge of her quotidian gyre advise travelers not to think hungry, lustful, or prideful thoughts, lest Hgrph take notice.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Valnirith, the Crucible</td>
<td> Valnirith was a Paladin in life, drawing on a vast well of personal fortitude in her pursuit of justice and righteousness. But when the minor God she served forfeited their glory in exchange for a throne in the hells, the power she had wielded was ripped from her. In her sorrow and terrible fury, she swore vengeance on her erstwhile master, descending into the pits to find him. She is quick to ally herself with those who will further her cause, but just as quick to cross those who run afoul of her paranoia.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Maelfestryx, the Schemer</td>
<td> Perpetually wandering amongst the mortals in the guise of a senile gnome, Maelfestryx randomly gifts travelers with small bobbles, trinkets, and gizmos that he uses to spy on the machinations of the world. He has gathered a vast repository of information, enough to blackmail a whole kingdom. His plans and motives at this time are uncertain, but when he finally makes his move you can expect that it's going to be a doozy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Geggomon, the Iron Toad</td>
<td> Geggomon resembles a great muscular toad with the head of an ox. His massive stomach is filled to the brim with iron ore, hauled from the earth by his army of slaves in order to feed his insatiable appetite. What he eats in iron ore is eventually shat out as steel, stronger than any forged by mortal hands.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ebrudaal, the Bone Tyrant</td>
<td> In life, Ebrudaal was a celestial prince; a great two-headed eagle with golden feathers. Cast out of the heavens for some sin long-forgotten, he spends his days in the depths of hell, now undead and in skeletal form. His rage at his punishment fuels a passion for violence and torture that he is all too happy to inflict on anything around him - even other great demons give him wide berth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vak, the Void Shadow</td>
<td> Vak's visible form is that of a man-shaped vortex or void; a hole in the universe from which erupts the wild winds of his hatred. It is said that the lightest graze from his finger is enough to utterly erase a being from existence. The only material thing able to touch Vak without being obliterated is the diadem that rests upon his brow, rumored to grant its wearer true immortality.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Yissik the Friendless</td>
<td> Yissik's passion is the perversion of loyalty and the twisting of alliances. He finds the most offensive state of the mortal world is the co-operation which some foolish souls call 'natural'. Wherever mortals stand together, wherever common ground is found, wherever differences are put aside, Yissik will turn his gaze - and begin his plans. All too often they succeed as the mightiest of bonds may be broken by the simplest of whispers, if they fall in the right ears. His mortal form is fluid, though it remains simple and gregarious, full of the seeming of goodwill and bonhomie.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fzar H'kat, the last necrophore</td>
<td> Fzar H'kat has always felt anger and ressentment for dragons, which had slaughtered most of his race several thousand years ago. The necrophore used to be one of the most powerful empire on the land and ruled with an iron fist, until they declared war to the emerald dragons. Necrophores are thought by most to be just a myth, as they haven't been seen aboveground in a long while. These cunning creatures have a distinctly creepy physique, with twenty long spider-like black legs under a green reptilian torso. Their small white eyes aren't of much use and they instead rely on their bat-like ears to navigate the tunnels where they live. A few decades ago, Fzar's village was found by a scout of the emerald dragons and subsequently destroyed. Everyone in his community was murdered, including him. Fortunately for him, he was a fervent cleric of one of the gods of death, which granted him a new life and some powerful necromancy abilities. In exchange, he has to garner 200,000 souls before dying again, or his own soul will be sent to the shadow realm and locked forever.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The seventeen bastards</td>
<td> Born of the union between a tricky gnome and several goblin widows, these seventeen half-goblin are especially dangerous. They have the savage cruelty of their mother but the cunning wits of their father, as well as a thirst for adventure that not a lot of goblins usually have. They look distinctively goblin, except for their orange hair which comes from their father. Quwip is the biggest and meanest one of the bunch, a large muscled half-goblin wielding two small waraxes and ruthlessly cutting down anything in his path. His fellow half-brothers and half-sisters are just as dangerous as he his and include talented sorcerers, agile thieves and battle-crazed barbarians. They managed to tame a pack of worgs which they use as mount.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kor, the fallen prince</td>
<td> A red dragonborn, banished from his kingdom for trying to overtake his father's throne. He wanders the land, searching for wealth and glory to eventually build his own empire and army in order to take back the kingdom that he believes is his. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and would gladly kill any number of innocent lives if it could bring him a step closer to his throne. He would probably sell his soul to Lucifer himself in exchange for his throne.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Juliet, the kyton mother</td>
<td> Killed during a particularly painful sacrifice, Juliet's soul was taken by the devils of the darkest depth of hell, where she became a deformed and monstrous kyton. In time, she ended up becoming a remarkably mean devil herself, gaining pleasure in causing as well as receiving pain. She eventually amassed a cult of devilish followers and even sent some expeditions back in the mortal realms to bring back new corpses and souls. A group of paladin came down to her realm to stop her after one too many expedition and although they eliminated a good bunch of her followers, she eventually defeated them all. Before consuming their soul, she forced herself on the leader of the paladins' team, which resulted 9 months later in a kyton-spawn tiefling. She loved her son so much and it broke one of her hearts when he fled to the mortal realms at age 13. She has been searching for him ever since, sending devil spies behind him in the world of men. She will stop at nothing to bring him back in order to give him the punishment that he deserve, no matter how many souls she has to destroy in her path.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghelia, the tormented</td>
<td> Ghelia can take many form in our world and every single of them cause mishief. She walks the land in search of lives to ruin. Either by destroying crops, reputation, marriages, companies, guilds or kingdoms, she strives to destroy everyone's joy in life and reason to live. She has been doing it for so long that she doesn't even remember why and she doesn't even take pleasure from doing it anymore. She simply does it because it's what she has always done. She hasn't been back in Hell for so long that she doesn't even remember what her true form looks like.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bashkatet, also known as Hilderoy the cruel</td>
<td> Hilderoy is the name of his human form. A bearded man with an eyepatch and a wooden leg, Hilderoy leads an armada of pirates that show no mercy and enjoy throwing people down at the "sharks". But Hilderoy is not human. His true form ressemble a enormous lamprey with twelve pairs of fins, that can stick his mouth to the bottom of a ship and wreck it from below. An army of smaller similar demons follow his ships along and wait patiently for the corpses of their master's fallen ennemies to be thrown from the side of the boat. If you see Hilderoy's flag approaching, abandoning your ship and jumping into the water is probably the worst thing you can do, for a quick death by sword is preferable to being eaten alive.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>He Who Walks Behind</td>
<td> A fiend so foul and devious it managed to shed its true name so as to never be a slave again. Instead, this devil serves as a patron to several powerful houses across the multiverse taking a single first born warlock when they come of an age of use. Then it sends the father on a suicide mission to help further its plans and rid itself of a loose end. Trailing behind, whispering, demanding, empowering, forcing a hand to some knowable goal HWWB is a master manipulator. This being is so potent it can even infest anything around its slave with a portion of its essence ensuring that it can never be totally destroyed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tychnazreht, of the Warp</td>
<td> This entity is so profane it warps reality around it and even those who look upon it. Longing to reach the prime material and forge a dominion of its own, it throws a net far and wide so as to grab the attention of any sensitive enough to the demon's call. Hence, most worlds hold a cult or other group dedicated to bringing their master through.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Melika, the Mistress of Torment</td>
<td> Melika, often called the Mistress of Torment, has been hard at work harvesting souls hoping to purchase a place in the infernal high court. She takes delight in tempting souls to gluttony and over-indulgence just so she can take things away when it suits her. She enjoys screaming and beautiful music, particularly tragic songs of death and sadness. Her sadism is only outstripped by her ambition, and the safest course of action with Melika is to avoid her schemes altogether.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Zelyria, the Flame Maiden</td>
<td> Zelyria the Flame Maiden is a demonic being with a strong connection to Elemental Fire. She is fond of dragons and burnt bones. She just wants to watch the world burn, espousing the power and might that only destructive fire can unleash. If she has any plans or desires beyond the destruction of all creation, they are beyond my capacity to comprehend.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kalex, the Eater of Heroes</td>
<td> Kalex is a potent shadow demon who styles himself as the Eater of Heroes. He loves bringing mighty warriors low by digging up their darkest secrets and using those secrets to exploit them to meet his own needs. He takes great interest in magical mysteries and odd lore. His schemes are complex, spanning continents and centuries. Some scholars believe he has had a hand in the fall of more than one of the great empires of the past.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gujerikk, Lord of the Blood Pits</td>
<td> One of the most prolific soul collectors in the Hells, Gujerikk is an enormous being with skin of scorched crimson and curved black horns. He rules over a small domain known as the Blood Pits where he personally torments many of the souls he collects. Scholars attribute the Tragedy of King Berend to madness, but many superstitious Northerners believe that Gujerikk's scheming had a part in the horrific tale. Many of these claimants have been haunted by dreams of their loved ones suffering in a place that matches the only known description of the Blood Pits.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gobbluth, The Tricky Devil</td>
<td> Gobbluth is a tall, handsome fiend, with a winning smile and neatly kept dark hair. He's not physically impressive, but he carries himself with confidence, and he thinks you should be impressed by his every word and every illusion he creates. Relying on his wicked good looks and his talent for illusions, Gobbluth's steadily seducing his way up the hierarchy in the Hells, and has made it as far as being a minor attendant in infernal high court. Perhaps, "minor attendant" is a stretch—he's a squatter. He snuck into the court and spends most of his time hidden in a large cupboard in the kitchens, slipping out to work his tricks on the low-ranking, female-identifying members of the court.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ohnalt</td>
<td> Bubbling up from pits of black shadow and malcontent, the Ohnalt likens himself as a Dark God. As a manipulator of men, Ohnalt binds himself to the feeble-minded, such as children and elderly, and sets them upon their loved ones. Should Ohnalt be extricated from his victims he retreats to his lair, Abraxas, leaving a convenient portal in his wake. Should those heroes be foolish enough to follow, he toys with their delusions of adventure, presenting them challenges and traps and treasure, in some twisted game only he could dream.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dorkhulhu, Goat-Merchant</td>
<td> Dorkhulhu has committed the greatest deception of all, appearing simply as some pagan god of trade to gypsy followers and bohemian merchants. He's become a popular entity to some, as tributes to him are made by trading and selling magical artifacts with adventurers. Gold that ends up in his followers possession causes his power to swell, and his favorite treasures all hold some deep connection to his realm. He schemes to draw the holders of his artifacts to the realm of Abracadabra, where he hopes to pit them against each other in a battle royale for amusement and coin.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Praelix, Fiend of Battle</td>
<td> All Devils have their own specialities and favourite targets for temptation, and for Praelix it is the battlefield that most readily draws him to the mortal plane. Unusually among the scholarly Phistophilus, Praelix loves to engage in discussions of strategy and tactics and will even don his custom leather armor (though best not to ask WHAT leather) and ride out on occasion. Some Diabolists consider Praelix's preference for claiming the souls of warriors to be a sign of intellectual weakness, a misapprehension Praelix himself readily encourages. Jovial and helpful, he affects the manners of a country gent - he even has a drawing room with weapons mounted on the wall. Each one is bloody and broken, and each is wrapped in a contract.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Naim'haera, Hateful Spearmaiden</td>
<td> A fixture of goliath myth and superstition, Naim'haera is the Diabolical Dame of Dishonor, and a brutally effective witch-devil. She often appears to weaker, less capable goliath, offering them power and prowess at a price. Her fee is always the same: the death of one's own family.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mordryn Wintersgrasp</td>
<td> A demon, posing as a line of kings, each male descendant remarkably similar to the last. The secret to this demon's ability to maintain a stable kingdom for so long is his taste in chaos; rather than give in to gibbering madness and lose his playtoys in a month or two, King Wintersgrasp uses his influence to destabilize the entire political climate for miles around, always coming out thick as thieves with the winning side.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The White Whispers</td>
<td> Less of a single demon than a wholesale legion of them, the White Whispers are the single greatest danger to travelers in a particular area of high desert. Each demon is bound to the shape of a single snowflake, but when whipped up by winds or stirred up by the passing of an unwitting traveler, they form a maelstrom miles wide, full of the howling and horror of Pandemonium itself. With the right wind, they could create a swathe of frozen death and atrocity across entire continents.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hallyx, the Viceborne Star</td>
<td> A devil of vast power of influence, made more terrible by the fact that nobody knows his or her true identity or location. The name "Hallyx" might simply be a title appropriated by one or many devils, or an actual name of an unknown being. All that can be known for sure is this: if you dig deep enough into the true roots of corruption and vice in this world, you will find your way back to one name.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grena Akssah</td>
<td> The primal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night can be traced back in history to Grena's more whimsical days. Grena is an Oni who stays out of the spotlight. He is the puppetmaster of the world. Pulling strings in courts, kingdoms and towns with no telling where his influence ends. Using his natural ability to shapeshift he gains access to the most powerful people in the land and gains their trust. The reason for his longevity is unknown though it is most likely due to the large sum of knowledge acquired over his time spent collecting artifacts and among the educated. The one thing he cannot hide with his shapeshifting is the eye of vecna that he has replaced one of his eyes with. Most if not all of his shapeshifted forms wears an eyepatch or similar way of masking it and they all tend to hum. Very few if any people can actually guess at his existence in the world however every child is taught the Oni's Rhyme: Lock the door, blow out the light; The hungry oni haunts the night. Hide and tremble, little one; The oni wants to have some fun.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Miasmus, The Creeping Hunger</td>
<td> Appearing often as an attractive tiefling wreathed in a cloud of grasping purple fumes, Miasmus breaks the mold of most demons. Not content with other demons' blind madness, the Creeping Hunger is driven and focused by his demonic desires. He plans and schemes like the best of devils, but ever the rage and hunger lingers beneath, cresting to the surface when things don't go his way. Of particular interest to him is answering the call of warlocks seeking a pact with devils. When he presents himself as such, he provides maddeningly complex contracts and asks for little in return for access to his power, masquerading as the lawful entities the warlock has planned for. However, he devotes himself to twisting the warlock's goals to base consumption and destruction, culminating in the eventual ruin of the warlock and the acquisition of many souls for Miasmus.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Malerus, the Man-Eater</td>
<td> A massive centaur, covered head to hoof in thorned plate armor. A bloodthirsty warlord, but also a superstitious being, he believes that devouring the hearts of his enemies will imbue him with their strength. Hunger never sated, he and his barbaric tribe roam the land as a nomadic scourge that crushes opposition under hoof and hammer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nurilla, the Stone-Mother</td>
<td> A first glance at Nurilla would give off her vaguely humanoid form, however, a closer inspection would betray her shimmering snake-like lower body. Don't look too closely though, her beautiful face is framed by a writhing mass of snapping snakes and an off-glance in her direction could be enough to turn you to stone. A freak of nature, her nest lays in the center of a garden of petrified victims. She lives in constant pain, laying clutches upon clutches of sickly, fragile eggs, which spawn chittering collections of colossal cockatrice. The nearby river is tainted with her infectious influence, and the local settlements are constantly under siege by her oversized offspring.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Beast of Brightmill</td>
<td> A seaside town, Brightmill's economy is heavily weighted in their fish market. However, a huge increase in missing persons cases have befallen the town as of late, and their economy has fallen into a depression as a result. A gargantuan Merrow, referred to as "The Beast of Brightmill" has been spotted on several occasions, lunging from the water's edge, and pulling people into the cloudy water. A well-fed creature, at nearly 15 feet long, many fisherman have lost their lives, trying foolishly to predict the Beast. The houses nearest the ocean have been abandoned, as huge claw marks line their doors and windows, and body parts won't stop washing up on the beach. Boats that are left near the docks are frequently missing, presumed to be either sunken or dragged off to sea by the creature. "The Beast" emanates an overwhelming aura of malicious intent, and some citizens see it as a punishment sent by the gods for the town's prosperity.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thom, Fiend-Lord of the Ordinary</td>
<td> Wherever Thom appears, magic disappears. His fiendish nature sucks out the magic out of reality itself. Every spell with a duration just flickers and fades once he nears. Magical fires dim, animated golems break down, and enchanted swords become, well, just swords. Thom hates all that is out of his daily routine, which mainly consists of an ordinary peasant's routine, with no magic involved and he'll go to incredible lengths to make sure no one breaks his routine. Wizards, Warlocks and sorcerers beware.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nycrosh, Duke of the Dead</td>
<td> Nycrosh is a small-time God of Death, who lures the souls from dying villagers into his own pocket dimension. His dimension is small, and only attracts the souls of specific areas, but he aspires to be a great god of death. Sitting rotting and decaying in his throne of bones, Nycrosh tries to make his afterlife the only afterlife.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Unseen and The Unheard</td>
<td> Two fiendish brothers that respective dominion over the sense of sight and the sense of hearing. The Unseen can completely escape the eye, as if he was invisible, sneaking through busy streets unseen. The Unheard eludes the hearing, slithering through creeky mansions unheard. They're assassins for hire, but ask for more than just gold to complete their job.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sword of Rhaggash</td>
<td> Like many legendary swords, especially those stuck in rocks, the Sword of Rhaggash promises the wielder to be king. However, once someone removes it from it's stone seal, the sword's dark tendrils overtake the wielder and take it over as a host. Rhaggash, king of a kingdom long forgotten, takes over, and will stop at nothing before it reclaims it's long lost kingdom.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>U'rg, A'rg and I'rg, The Endless Debaters</td>
<td> U'rg, A'rg and I'rg are the three fiends with severly clashing personalities, inhabiting a demonic host.. U'rg is the enslaver, and dreams of enslaving entire realms to supply him with luxuries. In battle, he tends to charge the strongest of his foes first. A'rg is the murderer, and dreams of a realm with bleak burned trees covered in innocent blood. In battle he goes after the weakest opponenst first. I'rg is the peacekeeper, and would love for everyone to just get along, and not fight for once. In battle, he's defensive, and tries to come to diplomatic compromise. Only one of them can be in control at the time, and they randomly take over from each other. If you listen very closely, you can hear the three argueing eternally in their collective head.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Losum, False Hope</td>
<td> Losum is a powerful contract devil that approaches people in the most desperate of situations and offer them a way out in exchange for their soul. He works hard to make his quarry extremely happy and accomplished. When they've reached a peak in their happiness he rips it all away and delights in their pain and grief.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Silas, the Vengeful</td>
<td> Silas is a devil that lives of pacts. He finds people who seek vengeance and helps them get it. He provides his contractees with a weapon that must be used to slay the targets so that he can claim their souls.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kraxan, Lord of Undoing</td>
<td> Kraxan was once the most powerful demon until the Order of the Iron Scales locked him into a book. Every page in the hefty book is a binding to keep him in place. That doesn't stop him from communicating with people who come near him. He's waiting for the day he can convince a fool to help free him.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Baroup, the Eternal Torturer</td>
<td> A being powerful enough to challenge Gods over dominance of the souls of the deceased, Baroup feeds with the pain and anguish he inflicts on the souls he snatches before passing on to the afterlife. His pocket demiplane, The Prison, is a locked place of eternal torture, and anyone entering would be hard pressed to get out.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Und'Aliber, the Shadow in the Light</td>
<td> Und'Aliber is a being of pure darkness encased in a shell of light. Shining like a (fake) beacon of hope, it takes on the form of whatever its interlocutor desires the most. Und'Aliber takes extreme delight in tricking followers of the Path of Light into taking evil actions, while still appealing to their sense of "justice" or "honour".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Balladar, the Infernal Seneschal</td>
<td> Diabolic Patron of courtly manners and intrigue, Balladar has agents in the most powerful kingdoms in the world, manipulating events behind the scenes. Not for any eventual goal, but for the simple joy of causing drama in the courts of kings. Backstabbing, secret deals, and lies are his domain, and whenever they are committed in the name of his worshipers, he gains power, no matter the goal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solzerik, the Whispering Shade</td>
<td> Solzerik is a petty demon, not powerful enough to be of any importance in the Abyss. He instead turns to petty murder, terrorizing villages and small towns. His true joy, however, is what comes after. Using illusions and other magic, Solzerik turns the townspeople against each other, eventually inciting riots and anarchy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The three breakers of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains</td>
<td> The breakers are three powerful demons who are the torture masters of the great demon halls. they are known far and wide for their malice and their horrible techniques</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Barluq Breaker of Body</td>
<td> One of the three breakers of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains, Barluq is called the body breaker because he enjoys not only defeating his opponents in battle, but utterly destroying them, he wields a massive greatclub with which the bodies of his victims crumble a sunder</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Garlrup Breaker of Spirit</td>
<td> The second Breaker of the great demon halls of the Grir'lith mountains. as the second Breaker, Garlrups task is to break the spirit of his foes. he fights them, then raises them from the dead, then he fights them again, carefully making sure not to completely obliterate the bodies of his victims, the victims come back with weaker and weaker bodies. but the fight does not stop untill the victim has lost all hope and surrenders itself to the third breaker</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lady Grith Breaker of Mind</td>
<td> The third and final of the breakers, Lady Grith tears the victims mind to shreds, she uses her powerful illusion magic to create horrible scenarios in which her victims are forced to abandon all of their principles of not only moral code, but logic and reason as well. the victims will make choices so difficult and twisted that in the end, their mind will be forever broken by the powerful influence of shadow magic, infesting and corrupting their mind as they work their way through her maze of horror.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grazzab, the Lightdrinker</td>
<td> Grazzab is a Shadow Demon who detests all light as an unnatural corruption of the chaotic void in the depths of the Abyss. Grazzab traveled the Planes, hoping to snuff out all sources of Light, and made periodic trips to the Shadowfell to try and heighten its influence over the Prime worlds. Unfortunately for him, he was snared by an ambitious wizard who imprisoned him in an idol on a Prime World, but Grazzab had the last laugh when his counterstroke ripped the wizard's soul from his body and became an energy source that Grazzab uses to spread magical darkness that literally steals, or "drinks" the light from the surrounding area. The wizard's tower is now Grazzab's lair, and though he is imprisoned in the idol, his influence over the local area is significant, and he can manifest himself within the total darkness of the tower's confines. Unwary treasure hunters looking to steal the wizard's old loot find their sanity wrenched away if they're lucky; if they're unlucky, they join Grazzab's retinue as Shadows that help guard the idol housing the demon's essence.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chamdar, the Soul Binder</td>
<td> Chamdar is a Chain Devil who delights in tempting mortals into dark pacts and contracts, and then using said mortals for sadistic experiments into the nature of suffering and torment once the terms of the deal are up. Chamdar first began to exert influence over the Prime when a sorcerer in a war-torn country sought to keep his family safe from the fighting--in exchange for helping construct an arcane sanctuary, Chamdar wrenched away the sorcerer's soul and tormented his family mercilessly in the sanctuary, often using the sorcerer himself to inflict the torments. Every night, the sorcerer had his sanity ripped away and he murdered his family in cold blood, only to later be confronted with what he had done. However, due to the nature of the contract, each day his family is restored to life, their memories fully intact, but the sorcerer's recollections were wiped away. Chamdar delights in watching just how torturous the family relations have become.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bizuloth, the Betrayer</td>
<td> Bizuloth, a powerful Archdevil, was imprisoned by Asmodeus for breaking an oath of service he made aeons ago. His once sharp wit and cunning intellect has decayed across millennia into a twisted mind bent upon the destruction of Asmodeus and all who have wronged him. Bizuloth's few remaining lesser devils seek those who could free their master and seek to make a deal for his release. Bizuloth, however, cannot be trusted, as he has lost his honor and any deals he makes are meant to be broken.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Steve, The Gruesome Trickster</td>
<td> As easy as it would be to kill anyone in his way on the path to his goal, Steve would much rather hire you to achieve his goal for him, then stab you in the back at the last possible moment. An expert shapeshifter and impersonator, Steve has walked many paths on the Material plane. The lives of the adventurers he has mislead have always been met with abrupt and unfair ends. Steve appreciates a good joke, and he has a ghastly smile to prove it. His name in itself is a ruse, as he guards his true calling as a secret known only to himself. His natural form stands 8 feet tall with smokey grey, spindly arms brandishing foot-long fingers with curled claws at the ends. http://i.imgur.com/Gt4G1WH.png</td>

Instead asks if they would be able to place a nickname upon their companion, a name between friends, a personal signifier that the pontifex can remember in their growing age—there are so many similar names in the world, after all. They have been doing this for some time now, and have only ten names they need to shed that remain. Despite the title, this being is not solely a withered pontifex, but can also appear as such: the pontifex regaled in milky robes and holding a candelabra, the goat-priest adorned in woad and untanned skins; the pilgrim full of pestilence and sunburned flesh; the lamplighter prophet with flame behind their teeth.</td>

Maintains an underhanded series of contracts with every devil in existence to funnel every single sinning soul towards Hell; this is not to torment them, but to relieve the strain on all the heavens from containing so many virtuous souls. Hell is spacious enough, and the souls are kept sleeping until they may be sent to their just rewards. May or may not be an actual toad, or every toad in existence that has ever been.

They see the dragon in her eyes. Those that do not pay their fealty and taxes go mysteriously missing. Curiously at the same time the Lady speaks of the great feast she just had. Her keep has a kitchen built for cooking humans. Giving the Lady the most taboo, sinful and exquisite taste she could imagine. While she seems entirely evil she does protect those that obey her word. Her dragon knights are treated with castles and keeps, and no other evil dares invade her lands.</td>

No. Vagrunad started leading the other chiefs, the warlords of the orcs. He started a campaign, beating warchiefs into submission with the raw power of his muscles. Within four years now all of the orcish clans are under his hand. Entire orc clans and warbands are used as a human warrior would use individual bands of soldiers. And now that the orcs are under his control Vagrunad looks to the rest of the world, to conquer.</td>

No one knows what the Viper looks like, or even if he has a physical body, even those wealthy enough to buy his services.

<td>Anarak Icewind</td>
<td> A human wizard/sorcerer who was infused with magic after an encounter with an ice devil in his childhood. The ice devil subconciouly whispers to him and incites his hatred for and anger at others. Because of the devil's whispers, he considers sorcerer's magic more pure than wizard magic ("it comes from the soul" etc...) and was greatly angered by most wizarding schools for his inability to produce or use any sorcerer spells that did not involve ice or water, and has withdrawn to a keep made of ice to attempt to learn how to produce any non-ice related magic. He is very bitter and hateful of the wizarding community and is very hostile to any other sorcerers' use of non-ice magic. (When he left one of the schools, he stole a wish scroll from one of the teachers and used it to imbue himself with the natural ability to detect magic. As a sad sort of irony; due to his inexperience with any non-ice magic, the effect the wish spell granted him was the ability to detect ice-related magic only, which only makes it easier for him to become angry at the use of non-ice magic.) All of his sorcerer spells must be ice themed/related: Ex. Magic missile shoots ice bolts, he cannot cast fireball with sorcerer slots, Floating disc and Mage armor are made out of ice, burning hands deals frost/cold damage, etc. He much prefers using his sorcerer spells than his wizard spells as he considers them 'unpure', but he considers himself worthy to use them over others because he has innate magical ability as well.</td>

Through his journeys, he tried to make the world a better place, to stop the suffering of others. However, as his journeys continued, he saw over and over again that much of the intelligent races' suffering came not from some horrifying creatures from another plane, but rather the intelligent creatures themselves. The more he saw this, the more shaken he became in his faith, until he cast it off entirely, believing with all his heart that the only way to end suffering was to end all life. Realizing he didn't have the power to do it on his own, he began making deals with other being, terrifyingly powerful beings, to help him gain the power to continue on his righteous quest. Eventually he grew more powerful than even the entities who granted him this power, and so he turned against them, breaking his word and slaying them all.

In fact, it is said that she created the Aboleths in her own image. She was locked at the ocean's floor by the elven god Deep Shashelus (I think that's how you spell it), and run through by a great fish hook, chaining her to the bottom of the deepest ocean, where she has sat, and waited, and birthed more monstrosities, waiting for someone foolish enough to free her.</td>

He has a penchant for liquor made/garnished with lemon, as well as fish. Any commoner on the street can point out the warm affectionate glow that seems to emanate from behind his form, and are touched by it in a spiritual way they can scarcely describe. Enter Christoff's ultimate betrayal and greatest deception; there is no Christoff. The Bullywug died as a tadpole decades ago, and this Rakshasha has assumed his identity in his plan for world domination. He never truly slays evil creatures, but banishes them to a hellish demiplane of his own creation.

"the Instigator," as it has been named, seems to act as a catalyst: infecting, goading, and feeding on the desires of these malcontents until their dark dreams and anger bubble over into reality. There are no records of the true name, appearance, or origin of this fiend, but such scholars as have studied it mostly agree on it being a harbinger of some sort.

Horace knows a great many things about a great many people in high and low places. How he knows these things is a mystery, but he's happy to talk to anyone who can stand his foul smell and who offers him some sort of human meat on which to gnaw.

She never eats the meat, preferring roots and the flesh of humans and halflings to poultry and gamebirds, but she has uses for fresh swan's blood in her spells and she delights in destroying beautiful things, especially with her long fingernails and teeth, each filed to a sharp point. There are herbs that can grow in fetid bogs that are of great use for Gladda's dreamwalking spells in which she catches glimpses of the future. The forest makes a home for creatures that eat these rare wild herbs before they can flower.

Thus far, she's only managed that feat for a few hundred yards around the pond on which her hut leans against a dead oak.</td>

The men of the North drove his people into the high passes of the Hoary Range two centuries ago, and rather than perish, he chose to wait. The cold, grassy meadows below mountains had been the winter home of the great elk herds and the wolves that followed them that once wandered the North. After the men slaughtered the herds, the giants took to eating the men's sheep and cattle when meat north of the Hoaries became scarce in the winter months. Yonal Yoglas decided long ago that to save the giants, they would have to face near starvation for decades as they gathered their strength from the scattered caves in the high passes. Now, he has over 150 giants, trolls, and other cast-offs of the Old North poised to launch a terrific campaign to drive the men back into the sea and reclaim the lands for the giants.</td>

Many sources claim the Servant favors killing by way of a huge scythe, some suggest a headsman's axe, still others by way of a poisoned dagger. Death is a mercy for all mortals who must suffer the uncomfortable pangs of life in this world. The Servant works tirelessly, wandering the lands, leaving plague, famine, and wars in its wake, striving to bring death swiftly to all so that they may find peace beyond the veil. One written account by a half-mad priest describes the visage of the Servant beneath the hood; the priest died three nights after putting the words to parchment.</td>

Alitheal slips into bedchambers in the pre-dawn light to gently kiss the life from innocents. Whole villages have lost most of the infants and children in a single morning at the hands of this angel of mercy. In most cases, Alitheal has moved on to deliver souls in another place at the next dawn before any can comprehend what has happened. A few dreamseers have received visions of Alitheal's work, and their nightmares have fed a growing fear and panic that has called on the bravest hunters to slay the Gentle Light.</td>

Already cool relations between the 'noble' races and their Orcish cousins had been exacerbated by the outbreak of the Patron Wars, and overnight, donating to the 'Half-Orc Orphan's Fund' went from high-profile charity to social suicide. As money ran low and the front moved closer, the working clergy found themselves in an impossible situation. Many fled from (or in some cases, to) the fighting, leaving only a handful of nuns to care for, protect and feed nearly two hundred children. With tensions fraying and food running low, Sister Lunette made the 'hard decision'; in the early morning, just after prayers, she methodically slaughtered almost sixty half-orc children with a pair of pruning shears. The other nuns, hesitant to turn their friend over to the authorities, restrained her with yards of knotted bed linens, and locked poor Lunette in the farthest corner of the cellar. A fictional Orc barbarian was named as the perpetrator of the heinous (if understandable) crime, and soon after the remaining orphans were dispersed and the orphanage shuttered. In one last, merciful act, the departing nuns unlocked the cellar, leaving Sister Lunette to the mercy of their God.</td>

But, in truth he's a nasty, vicious Goblin sorceror who alters his image to appear kindly and older so the cityfolk don't question his care of the children. Because the care he provides the orphans is to have them kneel and pray to their god while he puts a barrage of magic missles into the back of their heads. Then he teleports himself and the corpse to a butcher shop in a goblin town, where the butcher pays him quite handsomely for each child produced, as the meat is quite popular with the town's residents. Kral himself looks upon it as doing both places a favor. As the city doesn't care about the children, as rarely does anyone follow up to find out what happened to a child they drop off.

Half-mad with terror and obsessed with his quest for indestructibility, he now attacks outlying towns to abduct their blacksmiths and wizards. This serves the dual purpose of finding new craftsman who can add on to his ever-growing defenses, and putting said defenses to the test; although he is motivated by fear, Bastion constantly seeks to ascertain his invulnerability in battle. His many layers of armor and magical enhancements weigh him down so much that he prefers to go about on all fours, and Bastion's original shape is almost entirely obscured by his new, hulking form.</td>

Instead of a neck, it has a large flabby sack (like a frog's) that droops all the way down to its feet. It dwells in the deepest, most abandoned forests where civilization is far away. Its origins and motivations are unknown, but it dwells on one thing: to cause terror. The large sack on its neck houses a lung of poison that it secretes into the nearby atmosphere. One whiff of the gas, and the inhaler starts hallucinating: gigantic monsters chase them, they fall down a hole to hell, or their friends betray them. The hallucinations seem longer than they actually are. No harm is done to the person during the hallucinations, but almost all victims commit suicide or go insane due to terror. In their brief moments of lucidity, when their minds resist the poison, victims report a horrific croaking, and see a frail man perched on a tree fanning a large sack before they fall into another living nightmare.</td>

From a distance, the creature blends in with the branches of the tree. Then, while the victim is inside, its many mouths begin to simulate sounds of a far away celebration or party. Once the victim moves out to investigate, the Spindle stabs the creature and absorbs its skin into its skeletal frame, adding another mouth to its collection, and another voice to tempt travelers with.</td>

Most sailors can recognize a normal salvage: seaweed, wood scraps, maybe a fragment from an old ship. However, the most seasoned sailors will tell the deckhands to never claim anything from the waves in fear of the Dredge. if you ever see a locked chest, a woman screaming for help, or something that seems too good to be true, it's often the Dredge's tendrils tempting a young sailor to his death. Appearing after storms, the mess of tentacles and tendrils called the Dredge displays a tempting display of salvage that it collects: the items often are exactly what sailors want, sometimes even personal items. It's unknown where the creature gets these items, but as soon as anyone attempts to grab one, even if they use a hook or net, the tendril reels them into the deep with amazing force.

Taking the form of an enormous Dwarf, it could stride across rivers and smash through castle walls with ease. However, they made it too well. The complex mechanisms inside it, designed to allow it to repair itself, began to leech minerals from the rocks themselves, and eventually subsumed the Dwarves who dwelt inside it to become part of its mechanism. It is named after the tiny automata it creates, that form the first sign of its coming. Tiny things made of cogs swarm ahead of it, scouring the land of everything - animal, vegetable, or mineral. Everything is ripped apart into its component parts and conveyed back to the main fortress, now a bloated monstrosity of metal and stone. Inside, organic matter entwines around cog and wheel, forming a hideous fusion of meat and metal. Left to itself, it will scour the world clean of everything until it sits alone on the earth.</td>

<td>The Eating Slick</td>
<td> Summer is often a time of relaxation and ease, at least for those few that can afford it. One of the greatest pastimes of summer, then, is swimming, often in a lake, reservoir, or similar water source. In one such lake, secluded and idyllic, lives the Eating Slick. It is difficult to see, even under the best conditions; it manifests as a silent black circle that forms seamlessly to the water of its lake, not unlike an oil slick. Appearance is where the similarities end. The Eating Slick moves under its own power, and is utterly predatorial. It allows unsuspecting swimmers to move out into deeper waters, and once there, it consumes them. Whole. Its surface is like that of an Ooze, dissolving and searing flesh on contact, and with each eaten victim it grows. We are lucky that it lives in a lake; should it ever reach the ocean, there's no telling what horrors could result.</td>

<td>The Unhappy Blob</td>
<td> It was caught in the dark recesses of a cave and transported to the fortress where it was put into a deep pit. It wasn't happy about that, but then these strange creatures that caught it started throwing other such creatures down into the pit for it to eat, and that made the blob happy. It was quite happy for quite sometime, as the creatures would gather on the edge of the pit, make strange noises and then throw a usually still struggling creature much like themselves down into the pit for the blob to happily spend time digesting. But, then one day the Blob noticed that the creatures had stopped coming, and had stopped throwing him food. This made the Blob unhappy, and so the Blob decided to ooze his way up the sides of his pit and go in search of food. Which is really too bad for that nearby town.</td>

<td>The Lady of Justice</td>
<td> In a small mountain town there is a bronze statue of a woman holding an olive branch in one hand and a sword in the other. Before this woman is a bronze scale. Sitting in the basin opposite this woman are four small bronze men, sitting in the basin before this woman is empty space. Whenever a man or woman commits a crime, they are brought before the Lady of Justice, and put their head on the scales to be judged. Through strange mechanisms their sins are weighed. If they are innocent, the men will fall and the Lady offers them an olive branch. If they are guilty, the Lady swings her mighty blade and slays them. The angrier the townsfolk, the more vigorous the Lady strikes. A bloodthirsty mob throws a fugitive at her feet, willing the scales to tip. The criminal's head meets the scales and the men raise in judgement. The Lady tears away her face to deliver the kind justice the people truly crave.</td>

<td> The Ashen Legion is a force of conquest in it's purest form. It has no king and no nation. The grey forms of men in armor from a time long since passed leave a thick cloud of choking ash wherever they march. People in their path of all races and creeds are cut-down without thought. Their mute commanders mull over the tactics to take whatever happens to be in their path, issuing commands only the grey soldiers seem to hear. They ignore any other attempts at communication, dumb to reason and curses alike. The Ashen Legion burns cities to the ground, the only resource they value the ash of things that men have built. Felled soldiers return to the cloud, where they accumulate into new recruits, just as strong as the last generation. They hold territory simply for the sake of holding it, and they expand their borders with little rhyme or reason. Cities are razed, resources are ignored. Even though they march without purpose, their commanders are wily, and will win battles without pressing the Legion's immortality. Kingdoms are eradicated, ways of life are destroyed, women and children slain without thought as the Legion marches forward. And at the heart of their holdings an angry god lays slain, bleeding a pool tepid, grey War.</td>

Somehow the things he gives you always leaves you coming back for more and the favors he asks grow darker. Your soul is going to be his eventually, just give him time.

He gathered everything he could and never let a treasure leave his grasp. As his horde grew, he had to grow bigger and bigger homes to store it all. He also had to create more and more guardians to keep others out, until he was eventually alone with only this constructs. Clayven grew more and more paranoid and mad going so far as to accuse his own constructed guardians of theft, eventually destroying all of them. Left to his own devices, he slowly grew malnourished, afraid to leave his treasures unguarded. With time, his body seemed to wither away and his home did as well. Those who have gotten close to his home, have been chased off by a nearly naked, pale, hunch backed creature with one large eye and long claws on each hand.

Not seen for weeks on in, the man was presumed dead and lost. Now, each night, a horrific creature roams within the walls of the mad wizard's home. Its eyes gouged out and its mouth sewn shut.

That was centuries ago, but far from feeling blessed the Gatekeeper is now insane, wretched and wracked by the years.

Kain is a Godslayer, accomplishing this by seeking out worshipers of his target God and slaying them in masses to weaken the God's power as Faith is the resource for a God's strength and sets their hierarchy within the heavens. Kain is genderless and uncaring for mortal wants and needs and seeks only to rid the heavens of his former masters. Kain wields a colossal Scythe that opens portals to other planes/dimensions and makes wounds near impossible to heal from.

<td>The Black Helm of Sunbury Vale</td>
<td> Usually, things such as the Black Helm take shape in a wizard's laboratory on a dark and stormy night. The Black Helm, however, was created by an unremarkable blacksmith in the small hamlet of Sunbury Vale. The blacksmith had crafted a fine suit of armour for a noble to wear in an upcoming tournament, and an apprentice of the local arm of the Mage's College had been tasked with enchanting it. Unfortunately for all involved, his spell went awry - the armour, instead of receiving a defensive charm, received a life of its own. The now-animated plate mail attacked the blacksmith for berating the apprentice mage, and killed him. The mage was put to death by the inhabitants of the village - this enraged the armour [a Helmed Horror], causing it to wipe out the village. It's twisted and damaged consciousness began to reflect the fault for the mage's death not only on the villagers, but on all it encountered. The Black Helm now wanders the countryside, gradually roaming farther and farther from Sunbury Vale in order to sate its thirst for vengeance against those who it thinks killed its creator and master.</td>

<td>The Reacher</td>
<td> No one really knows what the Reacher is, or where and when it came from. Some say that its kind originate in the interstitial spaces between multiverses. To say that they exist there would be a mistake - no one knows if existence as we perceive it is possible there, even as a concept. What little is known about the Reacher is based on myth, speculation, and anecdote. Physically, it appears as a bright blue skein of energy stretched across a human skeleton - perhaps the Reacher is a parasitic organism still possessing the body of a long-dead host, or perhaps it's merely the Reacher's way of normalising itself to the Material Plane and existence as beings of this particular multiverse perceive it. The most interesting facet of the Reacher's existence is its interactions with matter. It has been hypothesised that the Reacher exists in five dimensions in this universe - the three spatial dimensions we can perceive, the temporal dimensions, and a fourth spatial dimension that is incapable of being interacted with by any being in this universe. This means the Reacher is able to pass through any form of matter directed against it, and even alter time as it pertains to individual objects. Indeed, the Reacher's name comes from a memorable incident in the 893rd year of the 4th Era, when it reached through the walls of a box that had been magically sealed by the six Archmages of the Adamantine Court, and in the process aging it into dust. Should the Reacher ever turn its azure gaze upon you, know that there is no escape - it is everywhere and nowhere, everywhen and never.</td>

With the correct rituals, a little magic and an unwilling sacrifice, ancient oaken branches reach down and embrace the pillar's unfortunate victim. Then the Fiend rises. Eight and a half feet tall, it holds itself upright with four enormous, jointed branches sprouting from its lower back. The victim's body sways in the wind, little more than a warm moist shell for the Fiend. Soon people in nearby villages disappear, only to be found impaled on withered pine trees. The Fiend will not abandon its grim harvest till all the Lupenwald's trees may feed on blood and bone.</td>

<td> Once the chieftain of several hundred goblins living under Rockbilt Mountain, Barg was content to run his little kingdom and get fat on the offerings of his kin. All that changed on the day a group of adventurers came into his cave, killing most of Barg's family and friends. The "heroes" attacked Barg in cold blood and left him for dead alongside a green ooze that had infiltrated the caves. The lingering magic from the spells unleashed in the cave reacted with Barg's hand and the dead ooze it was resting in. The reaction had a strange effect: When he awoke after the fight, Barg's arm was no longer flesh and bone, but rather had become a limb made of ooze. Fueled by fury and anger, Pukefist (as his legend is known among local goblins), ambushes humans and elves alone on the roads near Rockbilt. He uses his ooze-arm to choke his victims, and in some cases will even use it to melt the skin off their faces. All that was once Barg, happy, content and full of food has disappeared and a thin, angry, mutated mess is all that remains.</td>

<td>Fargith, The Giver of Dreams</td>

Some people who has seen the monstrosity says that it is incorporating the eyes into its own form. Forming them into a facsimile of a face; multi-faceted blue eyes, blue-eye-teeth, blue-eye-freckles. However, that is not all the eyes. Some are also found hanging on strings at random spots around the sewer. The second kind of people it kills are those that touch those eyes. Those people and their entire family. So, if you see a small, child-sized blue eye, hanging on a string, seeming like it is watching you, don't touch it. Just leave it alone. Said to be perhaps the most lethal assassin in the world. A figure wrapped in a hooded cloak of darkest black, beneath which appears to be only shadow. This is held up by those who proclaim him to have such abilities as being able to pass through barred windows and underneath locked doors. When the Shadow Assassin is hired, his victim is invariably found suffocated to death a few days later. But it is the payment that the Shadow Assassin demands that sets him apart: the person you love the most, passed by your hand to his. Nobody knows what happen to these loved ones when they are whisked away by the assassin. In the middle of the desert of Yum lies the City of Dreams. Some would say that it is ruled by a demon, but the demon himself and the people who seek him would say that it is served by a demon. For those that dwell in the City of Dreams have their every desire fulfilled by the demon. The resurrection of loved ones, a life in opulent luxury, the ability to kill and torture without risk or retribution. Newcomers to the city find it a kaleidoscope of dreams from the noble to the decadent to the horrifying. But all citizen are under the protection of the demon. By the power of the demon no citizen is allowed to experience any want or hurt or discomfort. Once a newcomer has accepted the demons pact and become a citizen, they never leave. Why would they?</td>

Materially, he is a giant tentacled mass of flesh and muscle with no distinct head, rather various eyes, nostrils and mouths are cut randomly into the rubbery flesh of his body. As he moves he passes between planes so that only cross sections of his corporeal form are visible, and so to any who behold him he appears to flicker in and out of existence like flames do, only where orange and red transparencies would be, solid fragments of muscle and bone and sanguine fluid phase in and out of sight, morphing and deforming, as though being sliced apart and healing over and over again. Tortured by his horrific existence, he has grown hateful and violent.

What started out as idealistic movement has become to turn more and more towards violence.

Kordel leads his band of mercenary soldiers, the Sons of the Dragon, through an equal mix of fear and loyalty. Famed for personally killing anyone who harms a man under his command outside of battle he is an almost father like figure to his soldiers.

Though, he keeps an ever watchful eyes on those who oppose his power, and much prefers to craft innocent-looking situations that put the strongest warriors and most knowledgeable wizards in great peril. He wishes only to rule the lands, unopposed and with an iron grip.</td>

<td>Nitarog the Impaler</td>
<td> Few orc warlords in history can compare to the legend of Nitarog Grimeye, Spear King and Impaler, and black-hearted mastermind behind the genocidal and destructive conquests of the Principalities of Allonel, and the nations surrounding them. He was an Eye of Gruumsh (Though not a spellcaster), possessing equal amounts of cunning brutality and brutal cunning, he was equal parts terrifying killing machine and master strategist. He possessed a single right eye, which was said to be able to kill the meek-hearted with a single stare. After first conquering the ancient mountain dwarf kingdom of Urshakd, he swept into the lowlands of Allonel, and struck down the human and elven Princes, burned their cities, and enslaved their peoples. By the end of his life, the once proud multiracial nations had been reduced to squabbling Orc chiefdoms, with the human inhabitants reduced to slaves, and anything even resembling a dwarf or an elf slaughtered.</td>

<td>High Fang-chief Gurubayogg</td>
<td> In an old deserted wood-elven realm, brought low by cultists of Baphomet, lycanthropy runs rampant among its current goblin inhabitants, at the behest of the Prince of Beasts. The various hobgoblin tribes, and the werewolf packs ruling them, have long feuded with one another, until one of the lycan Fang-Chiefs defeated all his rivals, and united all the various werewolf packs (And their tribes) into a single, great horde of primitive, barbarian goblinoids. With the unnatural werebeasts serving as a form of shock troops and cavalry, the hobgoblins swept into the other elven realms under the High Fang-Chief Gurubayogg, and were only barely beaten back by elite wood elf forces armed with magical weaponry. Gurubayogg survived, however, and still commands his loyal packs to raid the elven border hamlets. Should he be slain, however, the packs would fracture and go their own way...</td>

<td>Ser Dagmar, of Sevensooth Abbey</td>
<td> Ser Dagmar was also a very possessive man. He coveted the wife of his best friend and arranged it so that his friend's legion was caught in an enemy trap and eradicated. He then moved to comfort the grieving widow. When his own wife discovered this, she threatened to expose him and he cut her down in a fit of rage. Unfortunately, the widow witnessed it and fled to the fortress at Sevensooth Abbey with him hot on her tail. He demanded that the priests turn her over to them but they denounced him as an anathema in the eyes of the gods. That night, he stormed the Abbey while they slept and tortured the priests to get them to reveal her housing place, but none could tell him because she'd snuck away. Refusing to believe them, he tortured and slew every inhabitant of the keep until none survived. Outraged, the God of the Abbey cursed him to forever live a half- life, imprisoned within the Abbey, surrounded by the shambling corpses of his soldiers and haunted by the spirits of the priests.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grazlav the Fearless</td>
<td> Few dare to stand in the shadow of this great warlord. He gazes upon armies with a look as were he superior to all. Hobgoblin in nature, Grazlav grew up with war. His father being a warlord and his brother being in the army, the fierce hobgoblin learned the way of war at a very young age. However, not much later did his clever prudence turn into rage and revenge, as his right arm was cut off in a battle against an elven soldier. Not much later was his brother kidnaped and eventually killed by the great Silverant Legion. It was then that his fierce and utterly ruthless rage for the elves was birthed. He grew into a full-fledged warlord, sometimes called the One Armed, though he did have a false arm in place of his stump. To this day, Grazlav has been feared and has earned much respect among hobgoblins and goblinoids.</td>

<td>Fendris North</td>
<td> A human with a number of magic items on his person and the abilities of a sorcerer, he wants to rule the plains and manipulates other villains(read as: "Competition") into taking over regions for him, he then inevitably betrays them and takes their lands. Expect him to be making deals with the major villains using false names.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Admiral Eldrush Mac Drenghus</td>
<td> The Mac Drenghus family may be a well-respected clan, but they bear a single shame: Eldrush, the only son of the famed general Ilrick. While Eldrush idolized his heroic father, there was a single thing he idolized more: gold. So much so, that he offered to tell the empire that his kingdom was defending against about his father's plans for the war in exchange for a hefty sum of money. Eventually, he was caught, but not before being responsible for the loss of countless battles. He was exiled, before swiftly finding his place as an officer for the empire for which he spied. As he worked his way up the ranks, he became the admiral of the imperial fleet. As well as leading battles, he enjoys raiding merchant ships and pillaging port towns. If he were not flying the imperial flag, he would be known as a pirate king. He prefers to stay on his fortified galleon far away from battles he commands, enjoying all the luxuries he can afford. He is a skilled duelist, but this is not a skill he uses much - underhanded tactics are much preferred in single combat, especially if his underlings are there to assist him.</td>

<td>Prince Radcliffe the Halfdead</td>
<td> Feared by most of the nobility Radcliffe was given a position in the far northern edge of the Kingdom to defend it against the Barbarian tribes of the north. Here his impressive military mind was shown, and his skill with the blade. Upon the death of his father many will oppose the Halfdead's claim, and he will do anything to claim his birthright, even calling upon the powers of his ancient blade to summon the fearsome Order of the Grave.</td>

<td>Zarintra Torghym'tyl</td>
<td> Zarintra was born a High Elf to two clerics of Corellon. She was kidnapped shortly after birth during a Drow raid. The matriarch of the Torghym'tyl house thought it would be amusing to fully corrupt a child of Corellon devotees. The child was raised as though she were as a Drow, taught to find joy in subjugation, assassination, and torture. Her devotion to Lloth was absolute and she became a priestess at the earliest opportunity. With cold calculated intent, and a bit of luck, Zarintra ended up the only remaining heir to the Torghym'tyl house. When she ascended to the position she found no respect or recognition among her Drow "peers." Determined to prove her worth, and their foolishness, Zarintra packed up her house and took her retainers and slaves out of the city and into the Underdark. She was determined to find a way to destroy the nearest surface city. With this in mind she continued to do what she had been taught to find pleasure in. She subjugated, tortured and now conquered her way across the Underdark accepting any that would do her bidding and enslaving or killing those that would not.</td>

<td>Warlord Valeth</td>
<td> Class: Warlock Location: The Northern Dominion of Valkhan Flag: Two argent diagonals with demon’s head upon a field of Gules Motto: We Strike Fear The Northern Dominion of Valkhan is a young state, carved by Valeth Sunburst. Until very recently, the northern territories were mostly inhabited by different tribes of men and elves, nomadic hunters and shamans who would make their way from time to time to another city to trade the product of their hunt with the locals. Their land was strife with danger, from the wildlife but also from the conflict that would erupt between the tribes for dominance over the most frugal piece of land one could find in the Frozen Wastes. That changed with the arrival of Valeth. Found by the Jiansi Tribe when he was a young boy of three, Valeth was put under the care of the shaman, an old man name Xo-Shi and expected to learn the craft from him and replace him when death would claim him. The boy was talented and learn the craft quickly; Xo-Shi would claim that it was Jiansi spirit himself that had lead the tribe to find Valeth. Upon a very rigorous winter, Valeth’s mentor died of hypothermia and Valeth was left to assume the mantle of spiritual leader for his people. He served for many years in such a role, but felt that his talents were wasted as a simple advisor whose suggestions were often ignored because of his inexperience. Fed up with it, Valeth stood before the Khan and ask for combat. The fight was short and would stay engraved within the mind of all those present for years to come. Valeth’s blade struck true every time, drawing blood and staining the snow covered ground while his opponent never reached him. When the Khan had barely enough strength left to stand, Valeth struck with magic and the screams that followed were said to be heard for miles. Now Khan of the Jiansi Tribe, Valeth was free to pursue his own ambitions. He gathered the warriors and told them that a new age had come for the northern tribes. No longer were they to stand divided, unity was soon to be brought upon them. And so it was, that Valeth carved himself a path to power by defeating tribes after tribes and proclaiming himself leader of their people. When the last tribe fell under his sway, Valeth proclaimed the land that stretches from the Hoarfrost to the river of Syria to be under the control of the Northern Dominion of Valkhan.</td>
