[{"name":"Mamanto Tharl","genderRaceOccupation":"Etiquette and Subterfuge","description":" A haughty Elven dandy, Mamanto struts in front of his class, demonstrating how one walks like a noble. Sporting a frilled lilac chemise and skin tight black leggings, Mamanto projects his voice with volume and enunciates every instruction to his students like a real nobleman. \"Walk like them, talk like them or else you\u0027ll never get within a mile of them!\" His students try their best to focus, but his overpowering perfume clouds the air and dulls their senses. A similar perfume is given to promising students as a graduation gift; an alchemical concoction made to daze and distract those nearby, and mask the scent of any noxious poison one might carry."},{"name":"Professor Koro","genderRaceOccupation":"Working in groups","description":" The professor is not human, but some kind of aberrant squid from the far realms with immense power; he can move with blinding speed, is entirely immune to normal damage, and can channel his power into enormous explosions capable of destroying mountains. Koro is recognizably a threat to the entire world, but he teaches his class how to work together during assassinations to be able to accomplish feats they never could on their own, with the end goal being his own assassination at their hands. No class has ever been successful, but each gets slightly closer, and graduates with far more skill than most assassins who do not take the course."},{"name":"never","genderRaceOccupation":"Cleaning","description":" When teaching, there is always a scenario prepared, frequently from other instructors homework. He will point at important details such as spills or small \u0027evidence\u0027 (hair, dust, footprints, etc.), make demonstrations with various potions and magic items, and then leave the students to figure out what he means, only giving approving nods or disapproving stares. He will use useful magic for ease, but will never use verbal spells. Students tend to learn how to use corrosive potions, blood sponges, incinerators, spells (if capable), disintegration effects, flooding techniques, using bags of holding for corpses, and, if present in the world, basic knowledge of a sphere of annihilation in order to permanently destroy all that enters its shadowy domain."},{"name":"Drek","genderRaceOccupation":"Theatricality","description":" A lean muscled half-orc with a penchant for the dramatic. Named himself Drek, which translates into \"worthless\" in orcish, out of a constant melodramatic hate for his bloodline. \"Smoke and mirrors are just as valuable as a blade\" Teaches his students how to pull off a job in the most over the top way possible. Those who graduate from his course can make a kill look like an act of the gods, a devil\u0027s command, and anything in between. This course tends to attract mopey lone-wolf types."},{"name":"Dingo \"Silentfart\" Nackle","genderRaceOccupation":"Assasination in public","description":" Dingo is a smart and light hearted Gnome with bright, well trimmed hair, and sparkling green eyes. Excels at killing targets unnoticed, and finds great entertainment in taking out political targets among nobles. He\u0027s good with poison, and enjoys to use fairly unnoticeable tricks to kill his targets. Probably one of the most energetic lecturers, but tends to get really off topic, and regularly pranks his students."},{"name":"Oleg Bluntaxe","genderRaceOccupation":"Hitting people hard with an axe until they die","description":" Sometimes all you need is to kill someone without any form of grace to make an example, and Oleg is the man for just that. He\u0027s a bald, dimwitted ex-lumberjack, with scruffy beard and has a great passion for chopping more than just trees. Lectures usually revolve around hitting stuff. Hard."},{"name":"Toren Brightglow","genderRaceOccupation":"Dinner Etiquette","description":" Toren is a light haired, big bellied, constantly smiling dwarf. He teaches the proper methods of preparing a dinner for high class targets. The class focuses on such things as creating a menu, proper cooking techniques, silverware placement, and how to conduct light conversation. He makes each student throw a dinner party for the class each week, though its usually better to go hungry if you can\u0027t figure out if the nightshade is in the sea bass or the soup."},{"name":"Solana Ashaar","genderRaceOccupation":"Long Distance Targeting (Sniping)","description":" A cheerful half-elf with fiery red hair, unkempt and cut short. She is usually pleasant to be around, and she helps those who ask for it, but when she is serious about a topic she is intimidating. Students will need to have saintly patience and be prepared for plenty of... unorthodox training methods, as sniping isn\u0027t exactly a straightforward technique to teach."},{"name":"Sam","genderRaceOccupation":"Deception and Illusion","description":" While it is true that being a doppleganger Sam has an unfair advantage that they cannot teach to their students. Sam only takes in students with the drive to use spells such as \"disguise self\" and \"polymorph.\" Sam teaches that nearly anything can be hidden in plain sight, from the people next to you to the weapons on your person. Sam has a tendency to walk into the first day of class as a student in naught but their uniform, and then walks to the front of the class and pulls out all manor of weapons from misc. polymorphed items. They also teach a class on conjuration for the higher level students."},{"name":"Velyr","genderRaceOccupation":"\"You never climb a castle wall without knowing what you\u0027ll find on the other side.

He seems to have short hair, trimmed beard, and very well fitted dress. His manners are fluid, automatic, and above all precise. By all appearances, he would pass by unnoticed in any crowd of well-to-do citizens. By all appearances, he has a warm, soothing voice which makes those unwary feel safe near him.

His classes, while challenging, are always reasonable and he takes a lighthearded approach to economic math. When he digresses though, his stories get a bit... intense.

Varus is a black haired, pale, centuries old elf, who talks with quite... pronounced... articulation. His robes hide his features so well he appears as a specter most days, if he appears at all. It amuses him to teach while invisible, to better catch slacking or cheating students. Incidentally, it also aids with visual demonstrations some days. His class is the most difficult to pass in the entire academy, due to the rigorous study and absolutely vicious classes. Being called upon to recite ingredients or cooking methods is quite dreaded, as failure could mean imbibing any number of potions to demonstrate the antidote application method. It would be quite an odd semester if every student survived, though Varus has never deliberately killed any of them. Yet, anyway."},{"name":"Loraine \"Doc\" Highfellow","genderRaceOccupation":"Practical Anatomy","description":" A former medical practitioner during the days of the Great plague, Loraine is cold, calculating, and unforgiving. She is a slender human woman, rather unremarkable looking, with brown eyes and shoulder-length black hair. The first day of her class is infamous among students, as she brings in two live humanoid subjects, and orders a student to attempt to kill one by stabbing them once. Often, it results in several minutes of agonized screaming from the victim, during which Loraine proceeds to demonstrate the importance of a thoughtfully-placed knife, ending the other subject\u0027s life quickly and quietly in naught but a few seconds. Her final exam can be heard throughout the school as, for a brief moment, dozens of people cry out in pain and fear before their lives are swiftly and efficiently snuffed by the students."},{"name":"Darrio","genderRaceOccupation":"Culinary Animosity","description":" Darrio is a human male of average build with slightly graying hair. He is most often see dressed white, the way you would expect any good chef or cook to be. The first few weeks of his class always start with regular cooking lessons, to make sure the students can actually pass as, at the least, competent cooks. From there, he moves on to teaching them how to mix various ingredients into the food, to produce non-fatal effects such as diarrhea or vomiting without any noticeable unusual taste. The final portion of the course is fatal poisoning, by method. Successful students can induce death that looks like choking, heart attack, or almost any natural means. The absolute top students are those that can tailor mass consumption meals to specific individuals: A soup that targets only the duchess, bread rolls that only asphyxiate the diplomat from the foreign country, wine that only burns the esophagus of the famously vain opera singer, etc."},{"name":"Mordak Chainboot","genderRaceOccupation":"Prison Infiltration and Breakout","description":" Mordak is a worn, sickly-looking dwarf with a smoky-gray beard barely longer than a stubble. In his lectures, he has a tendency to wax on about his own claim to fame: infiltrating a supposedly inescepable dwarven prison and breaking out after assassinating his mark. Despite the occasional reminiscing, his lessons do cover all the aspects of assassinating an imprisoned mark, from techniques to learn the prison layout in preparation, to various ways of securing an unguarded moment with the mark to carry out the assassination."},{"name":"Jiang of the Silent Afterlife","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Making Sure Dead Men Tell No Tales","description":" In a world where ghosts exist, it can be hard for assassins to maintain their anonymity when their victim\u0027s spirit can still point fingers. Jiang has mastered the arcane arts of keeping ghosts silent, often by destroying the ghost as soon as the spirit leaves the body or by destroying the spirit before the body dies. She honed her ghost-slaying talents under the tutelage of a temple to Pelor, and has learned arcane rites to hurry a soul into its proper afterlife, where it can\u0027t tell stories, in a temple to the Raven Queen. Her classes tend to be underfilled, as few respect the value of her lessons until a paranormal investigation begins, and the spirit is at large."},{"name":"Rylni of Grayshear","genderRaceOccupation":"Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, teaches Scrying Ia","description":" This beady eyed gnome wears a light gray robe that contour her body just enough to reveal a gaunt figure unfit for strenuous work, unlike others at the academy. She has an oily and freckled face which both accentuate a scar that runs from her jaw line to her right cheek bone. Often mistaken for a student, Rylni distinguishes herself through her unforgettably explosive temper when she\u0027s outspoken. Rylni has the difficult task of performing fact checks on instructors who applied to the academy. Students taking her class learn elementary applications of the scrying orb, amongst other divination tricks."},{"name":"Lokeris Dark (the third)","genderRaceOccupation":"Justification","description":" A silver-tongued Tiefling fellow, always dressed impecably in the finest clothes, elven in style of course. His manners, always impecable, are totally disarming, charming even the most savage of beasts. His wit sharper than the finest blades the forgotten realms could offer. And there\u0027s the rub. You see, learning to kill subtly is one thing, learning to give a reason to kill is another. Under Lokeris\u0027 tutelage, students will learn how find their target\u0027s weak spot, whether it be cards, dice, or just their honour, and exploit it, needle at it until the target attacks. Remember, it isn\u0027t murder if it\u0027s self defense."},{"name":"Matron Sarah","genderRaceOccupation":"Common folk manipulation and political subterfuge","description":" Matron Sarah is an elderly human, previously married to a farmer before he and her children were murdered by soldiers of his lord. She has a kind smile and kinder eyes, and teaches the better off students how to fraternize with peasants and urchins. This is a unique brand of assassination she teaches; turning once loyal subjects against their leaders, typically through violent revolution. Despite this facade, she cares little for the well being of the people, only taking pleasure in the upsetting of power balances and political instability that follows. The loss of her family broke her, and she sought vengeance by making a pact with a particularly capricious fey in exchange for the power to rein chaos on the material plane."},{"name":"Therian the Flame","genderRaceOccupation":"Making it look like an accident","description":" Seen as a joke by the other teachers LoneStar is, nonetheless, One of the most well known assassins ever. LoneStar\u0027s reputation exceeds his actual success rate by many levels, however. LoneStar teaches that one must take pride in their work, and everyone should know who killed the mark. Studebts practice boisterous monologues while hanging from rafters, taunting their target while it summons its guards, and develop their own flamboyant \"signature technique\" with its own equally edgy name.   Therian is a middle aged man, brown hair and bronze skin. He only wears a pair of white baggy clith pants, and his scimitar strapped to his waist. Therians class teaches students how to best utilize poor building techniques, such as weak foundations, or wood structural beams, to literally \"bring the house down\" on their target. Graduates of this class go on to become Expert serial arsonists and impromptu demolitions crews, as well as being highly sought after sappers in times of war."},{"name":"Daven of Crowbridge","genderRaceOccupation":"does","description":" Jethro Eckhardt is a lean, bespectacled, scholarly looking sort, often dressed in doctor\u0027s robes and accompanied by his distinctly humanoid Clay Golem, D4. Together they teach the principles of where to hit a target where it hurts most, and just how to do it, with Jethro covering the theoretical side of things and D4 acting as a living training dummy of sorts for practical demonstrations. A cheerful man who enjoys his work, Jethro has developed quite the bond with his classroom assistant, and has taken to referring to D4 as \u0027David\u0027, after the phonetic spelling of his College asset ID.

You might have seen him, but your eyes probably just passed over him. He\u0027s about average height, and his hair is shortish, or maybe longer? But anyway, Bob gets rid of people. Very important people. Assassinating someone important is hard. Not the part with the dagger and the muffled scream and the look in their eyes as they come to grips with the fact that this is their last moment on the material plane. That part is easy. It\u0027s the part after, where the clerics come in and make a big show of speaking with his corpse, and the divination wizards come, all eager to curry favor with whatever poor bastard now has to sit his arse on the throne. Now there are people looking for you, and you\u0027re living out your life in a lead-lined room in some backwater safehouse. Bob doesn\u0027t teach you to assassinate people, like the others. He teaches you how to erase someone. Come dawn, no one will even wonder who used to eat the bacon and eggs the cooks are busy making or whether someone sleeps in that big bed. They\u0027ll just be gone, and you won\u0027t even have to hide, because no one is looking for you."},{"name":"William \"The Raven\" Finley","genderRaceOccupation":"Interrogation Resistance","description":" A calm old wood elf with dark brown hair, dull green skin, and hazel eyes, Silaneth sometimes spends an entire class with her nose in a book and her back turned to the students. The next day, they all receive marks. No one is quite sure for what. Some students leave in the middle of class and get a perfect score, others a failing grade for the same stunt. The joke around the academy is that it\u0027s a course in patience, not in stealth. Indeed, Sila often admonishes her students for excess haste. \"If you don\u0027t know more about your mark\u0027s routine than their own family when you go in for the kill, you are making a dangerous mistake. You can learn how to clean up the murder scene from Remmings, but if the mark\u0027s head of security walks in on you because you don\u0027t know his schedule, you\u0027ve got a bigger problem on your hands.\" Although she does teach various techniques in stealth and long distance tracking, the most useful part of her class is the weekly assignment to each student: to follow another professor in the academy, learn as much about their life as they can, and to not get caught. By the end of the course, the best students are more than capable of avoiding detection while tailing even an experienced mark. On the first day of the class, William scans the room with his deep, black eyes. Later, every student swears that his piercing gaze lingered on them just a little longer than everyone else. Everyone admits that when William looks at you, it feels like he can see directly into your soul. He was a human soldier in a special operations unit reporting directly to the highest officers in the military. A natural born leader, he did not have any profound or unique skills save that of his magnetic charisma and unyielding will. His class is well known to be grueling and unforgiving. There are no marks, only a pass or fail. Those who have passed the class, are known around the academy and either widely respected or else feared. He begins his first lecture with this, \"Most of you will fail. If you have a shred of doubt in your ability to pass this class, quit now. Nine percent. That\u0027s how many of you I can expect to pass this course. Just looking around the room I can already tell which ones of you will quit within the first week.\" He starts pointing at the students and calling them out by name. He makes an effort to learn the names of every person in his course before they start so he can verbally abuse them from the first day. Very quickly, the students realize that during his class, he can be abusive and cruel, but is kind and friendly when not in class. He was a POW of the Drow for over a decade and sometimes recounts the sickening torture they utilized to try to get him to talk. He likes to lead groups on hikes, go camping, and tell war stories around the fire when he is not teaching. During one week of classes, towards the end of the course, students must go through hell week. This is a week of no sleep, no food, no rest. They are tortured, they are poisoned, they are bewitched. Every possible things is done to get them to give up. All they have to do is say they\u0027re done and all the pain stops. They are given a warm delicious meal in front of their peers who are still struggling. Those who don\u0027t give up, have almost passed the course. They have one final exam: to not give up a piece of information to the students of Dareth \"Feelgood\" Woren through a day of torture. Selected Quotes: \"Your mind is your most powerful weapon and your biggest weakness. When I lived with the Monks in the mountains of Harkonell, I learned to strengthen my mind. Your assignment, from this day to the end of this course, is to meditate while in pain. Try for an hour a day. I have a list of sufficient ways to cause pain posted on my office door.\" \"Always remember, if you\u0027re being tortured for information, that is the only thing keeping you alive. Revealing it will result in certain death. We strengthen the mind and the will because when they are weak, death will seem like a welcome reprieve.\" \"The most powerful torture is psychological. They will tell you they\u0027re torturing your family. They will show you what may or may not be illusions of your family being tortured. They will force you to ingest poisons that cause you to forget who you are. Sometimes they will offer you something enticing instead. They might offer you riches, immunity, protection, freedom. These are all techniques to get you to break. Do not fall for them.\""},{"name":"Vulpis Dreamwine","genderRaceOccupation":"Truth And Truth-Seeking","description":" A sallow elf with sunken, always-wide eyes that hint at an untenable sleeplessness. Vulpis has a drunken gait, relaxed charm, and a penchant for purple in his shoddy patchwork outfit. \"Get comfortable. Sometimes what you seek is just a friendly conversation away.\" When he\u0027s not telling stories about epic triumphs and adventures-gone-wrong, he casually chats with his students about their past, their aspirations, which classes they\u0027re taking with which professors. A Nat 20 Insight roll on one of his stories will reveal that some part of it is dishonest. On the last day of class, each student awakens to find something precious has been stolen from them. The classroom is abandoned and locked. If investigated, the school has no records of a Vulpis on staff or a \"Truth And Truth-Seeking\" class."},{"name":"Alstair Horngrave","genderRaceOccupation":"Above and Below, or How to Use Infrastructure","description":" Alstair is not usually known for his manners or his appearance, however he is known for his entrances. At the beginning of each term and before any practical examinations, he makes a point of entering the room from somewhere other than the door, once even rising from the ashes in the nearby fireplace. His course mainly revolves around using sewers, rooftops, and crowded streets to disappear or approach your target unseen, taught through theory and anecdotes from his days as an urchin. On rare occasions, he\u0027ll have some of his colleagues play the role of a student as a test, blending in with their classmates for weeks at a time until that first test is deemed to be concluded. The more notable of his lessons are held outside the classroom, teaching students through real life experience in controlled environments."},{"name":"John Graves, Insurance Adjuster","genderRaceOccupation":"Chaos Based Magical Assassination","description":" John Graves, Insurance Adjuster, is a pillar of the community, often found helping the local priests, donating food to the poor, and helping people recover from horrific accidents that he often causes. The name, John Graves, Insurance Adjuster, is a legacy title, passed down to the highest ranked assassin in the guild (often with several \"John Graves\" active at a single time period, working independently). Each Graves acts slightly differently; however, they each have two things in common. They run a \"respectable\" business, often insurance, but another similar profession works too, such as pharmacist or banker, and Graves has made a deal with some sort of Chaos God or Great Old One, which he sells the souls of those whom sign his contracts to the chaotic one, whom eventually kills them in a chaotic accident and feeds upon the chaos surrounding their untimely death. (Chaos loves collateral damage, but the only person whom ever dies as a result of these accidents is the victim, no matter how much destruction of property or others whom are injured in the process.) Grave\u0027s weapon of choice for his assassinations is based upon a misleading contract which binds the souls of those he insures to be eventually killed in horrific accidents. Graves is able to prevent an insurance contract from causing an accidental death by burning the contract prior to the death of the signor, or instantly \"activate\" the contract (and cause the accidental death to occur before the next New Moon), by signing and executing the contract in his own blood. He trains new assassins by teaching them actuarial tables, and in all ways making them a perfect \"drone\" within his business. All initiates also sign a contract upon joining the Guild. Once an initiate has proven a perfect \"Insurance Adjuster\" or \"Bank Teller\" or otherwise, they are inducted into the secret society and given the option to become a new John Graves. If the initiate declines, the Chaos God eats the initiates soul. It is unclear how Graves monetizes his assassinations, and each Graves has independent motivations sometimes at odds with other Graves. One common tactic is to gain as many insurance contracts with high ranking members of society as he can infiltrate, and then \"selling\" the death to his target\u0027s enemies prior to their death."},{"name":"Haber \"Gasman\" Devronich","genderRaceOccupation":"Poisons, potions and chemistry","description":" Lastman, as he is most commonly referred to, is a generally unremarkable human, and comes to each class with a fresh costume, set of mannerisms and name.

A tall, bulky half-orc, Shaav wears armor almost constantly, and will challenge individual students to duels if they slight him. He is surprisingly eloquent, and knows almost every book of sword theory front and back. He has never actually worked as an assassin, but quickly teaches his students that no fight will ever be between them and a similarly-sized individual. A tall, imposing elf, Devronich is covered in centuries of burns, scars and boils, and always wears an asbestos hazard suit for protection while in class, and more than once he has accidentally incapacitated his entire class. He constantly coughs and giggles to himself, and those who are in his classes rarely stay for more than a semester, and few have survived more than two."},{"name":"Kethan Quentith","genderRaceOccupation":"Applied Anatomy","description":" A scholarly Drow man with round glasses and tousled white hair, generally absent minded and gregarious but keenly focused when it comes to surgeries, dissections, and other less reputable applications of his craft (torture foremost amongst them).

SEHC-KE4WWMBQ teaches the uniquely hobgoblinoid assassination tool of natural causes. Hobgoblins mercilessly execute any who use the sacred arts of battle to kill dishonorably. And since the only acceptable ways for a hobgoblin to die are in battle or of disease, hobgob assassins need to get creative. And they don\u0027t use poison.

There had been less wise men, but nobody believed them, after all they had all shown to be fools, scoundrels or both. The first one ended up on the streets after utterly ruining his merchant family\u0027s legacy. The second was nothing but a lowly thief and hung for his crimes. The third, he died to his brothers rapier, a befitting end for seducing the poor brothers wife. He had taken no pleasure in their deaths, why would he?

Before the year is out she is a tragic widow with a dazed look in her eyes and many people falling over themselves to console her until she disappears to ‘recover’. Where she is short on time she has been known to use pride and folly to her advantage, convincing the unsuspecting into ill-advised bets that lead to their demise. Whether it’s to protect her honour, to impress her, or simply her gentle coaxing into a bad decision already waiting to happen, Lady Haverly has seen many a mark fall to their death on the duelling crowd, attempting impossible feats or simply falling into debt so heavy that taking their own lives seems the sensible option.

That first impression would be correct. Kerlead is loud, bombastic, brazen, and can take out an entire guard barracks with a single spark. Kerlead\u0027s specialty lies in explosives and artillery, but is highly knowledgeable about most other heavy weapons. When stealth is not a feasible option, the constantly drunken dwarf\u0027s ideology is to \"level the playing field.\" Literally. With high explosives.

During his class, students will learn mostly technical information about various explosives, artillery pieces, fuses, and trigger mechanisms. Information includes kill radius of explosives, simple ballistic maths, ammunition types and uses for artillery pieces, and speeds at which different fuses burn in different weather conditions.

Kardal\u0027s style is in the failure of mechanical components: wagon axles breaking down in the wilderness, ships breaking apart at sea, traps triggering when they shouldn\u0027t, etc. He is a very patient instructor, and he prefers the hands-on style of learning, helping his students make clocks, springload mechanisms, pressure switches, and all sorts of other mechanical toys. Aside from his famously mellow demeanor, however, he has one other trait students remember him for: an alarming tendency to forget just how much stronger he is than everyone else.

Sometimes when your target is too high profile to be able to dispose of it on the more classic methods, so it\u0027s just more expedient to, ahem, \"convince\" them that it\u0027s on their best interests to skip town, or to step down from their public position.

It is certainly jarring to see her demonstrations in class, where, in mere moments, she goes from hobbling about to a blurred whirlwind of blades and then back again."},{"name":"Shagram Doon","genderRaceOccupation":"Enticing the Masses and Guiding the Unguidable","description":" His view: \"Why get your hands dirty if you can convince a crowd to do the work for you?\""},{"name":"Rickert Oswald","genderRaceOccupation":"Leaving a Mark","description":" Rickert is a tan skinned human, wrinkles just starting to line his face and the color fading from his hair. This isn\u0027t uncommon with assassination instructors, as typically one doesn\u0027t become a teacher until they have retired. He teaches an art so often forgotten in a profession typically about covering up the messes they make, which is how to make an assassination look as grisly as possible. Clients who want their enemies to know they mean business seek him and his style out, as the body is found with marks of torture, or displayed in ways that invoke true horror. His most famous tale is a political assassination where he had managed to cook and prepare all the organs of his victim and lay them out at his estate for a dining party to find mere hours later. He enjoys telling this story as his class is eating lunch for the day, as he greatly enjoys the reactions. \"You don\u0027t need to make anyone suffer. As long as the remains make it look like they did, no one will even want to know the details.\""},{"name":"Gorg Aselif","genderRaceOccupation":"From Sewers to Skylines: Blending in and getting out in all occasions","description":" While there are many classes and ways to learn to get in and out of a kill, Gorg\u0027s class is one of the few that teaches you how to get from the sewer at noon, into the fancy ball before nightfall, and out the front gate a little past midnight while looking and smelling like you were invited. His tactics use previously learned material, such as moving through sewers and climbing buildings, and mixing in new methods such as stashing clothes and planting false evidence. The course also teaches other diversions, when to keep a low or high profile during an event, and how to properly judge the distance from a rooftop to the ground and tends to attract students that are less suited for an actual fight and more equipped to stir up a panic and leave. Gorg is a gnome with a varied past, supposedly raised by goblins and trained by noblemen, he teaches most lessons in the field, meaning in the sewers or on a roof, and often gets the class to go to royal balls, for free of course."},{"name":"Dedon Greschmach","genderRaceOccupation":"Tailing","description":" Greschmach is a short, dark-haired half-elf who teaches how to follow a mark in cities, towns and ports. He teaches disguise, distraction and movement techniques so his students can follow anyone through any crowd.

He was a prodogy, quickly surpassing long time felons and finding his niche as a reliable framing artist, and quick slit specialist. After half a lifetime murdering for money, he was recruited by your prestigious school, to teach and deal with any...liabilities. Seen as one of the more engaging teachers, Maldova entertains his classes with live demonstrations and games of find the teacher. He can always be seen picking at a pomegranate with any one of his ornate throwing knives, or charmingly whispering in any of the curvier students ears."},{"name":"Sir Willem LaFortier","genderRaceOccupation":"Last Resort Swordplay","description":" A large but old human man, built like a buffalo, and with grey hair. A laboriously curated handlebar moustache exquisitely curled. He talks like a gentleman, acts like a gentleman, and expects great honour and decorum in his class. Looking for busywork after retirement, he is employed due to his skill at traditional swordplay - an assassin\u0027s final recourse."},{"name":"Blake \"Shadowblade\" Carn","genderRaceOccupation":"Sleeping targets","description":" Half-orc man, Blake moves like a cat, utterly silent, and has a penchant for surprising his students at innoportune times. Though in class he is deadly serious, outside he uses his skills to play playful and innocuous pranks on both students and teachers alike. His class focusses on dealing with situations where an assassin has to deal with sleeping foes, and ensuring constant stealth and awareness."},{"name":"Freya Elardi","genderRaceOccupation":"Information gathering","description":" A high elf woman, Freya has flowing blonde hair, stunning good looks, eyes like an eagle, and a smug egotistical attitude. She teaches everything from spying to research to torture, in a varied yet harsh curriculum. Freya has spent hundreds of years perfecting her class, and brokes no failure from her students."},{"name":"Lord Ashcrofte","genderRaceOccupation":"Rumor Mongering","description":" Lord Ashcrofte is a tall, thin man of somber demeanor with a knack for charm. Having spent the majority of his youth in various noble courts, he has developed the acquired taste for politics, with especial love for the power of whispers. Lord Ashcrofte will teach these skills to his hand-picked students for a price, a favor to be claimed at a time of his discretion. Lord Ashcrofte instructs individuals in the ways in which they can become a trusted confidant, an ear to whisper into, a shoulder to lean on, a mistress to the target - whatever it takes to get the information which is needed. After all, everyone has secrets which can be advantageous to the holder."},{"name":"Quintius Auralea","genderRaceOccupation":"In Plain Sight - The Fine Art and Etiquette of Honorable Murder","description":" \"The way to a man\u0027s heart, they say, is through his stomach. But if you want to reach his brain, I recommend the eye socket.\" The mechanism of the honor duel exists in nearly all cultures, and the daring assassin may bend it to his will to kill his target publicly, decisively, and (most importantly) legally. Quintius, once the Count of Imperia, is a master of this technique, which involves drawing the target into an honor duel through social maneuvering. And, of course, winning the duel. He presents himself as a squat little pudding of a human with a ruddy complexion and drooping eyes, which he later reveals is part of the game. \"The target must see you not as a predator, but as prey. Draw them in, then, like the viper, strike. The involvement of disguises, aliases, and poisons where necessary are recommended, and the establishment of a reputation is the death of this art.\""},{"name":"Janus of Undertown","genderRaceOccupation":"Contacts and Conspirators","description":" Once a member of the Thieves Guild (or two, or three), Janus began applying his talent for gathering and organizing people to the cause of murder only a few years ago. Strangely, the course of study is taught by a different person each day, reading from a long scroll. \"The greatest assassin,\" Janus writes, \"are never seen and never heard. This might imply stealth, but simple absence can suffice.\" The class describes establishing and running relationships with a variety of agent types, including fanatics, patsies, hirelings, and even true partners."},{"name":"PLEASE ADHERE TO THE FORMAT","genderRaceOccupation":"The History of the Nobles","description":" Welcome to the 1st event of the Academia Month: 10k Professors. For this event, let\u0027s brainstorming up 10k NPCs who are all professors. This collective list can include professors of any discipline! This list can then become a tool for any DM who needs a professor to just reach into and pull a fun one out. Perhaps, this will even inspire some interesting campaign ideas. There are currently 57,863 people on this subreddit. It should be fairly easy for us to get over 10,000 NPCs."},{"name":"Redna Shortwit","genderRaceOccupation":"Etiquette and Social Graces for Young Noble Women","description":" She is stout, dowdy, only about five feet tall, but projects a grand and stately image. She is strictly proper. A modest and prudent puritan, and obstinate in her expectation of the same from her students. She professes a reverence for the patriarchal hierarchy and for the domestic position of women in the Kingdom of Prideline, she has been a leader in the education of hundreds of proper young women and, in the eyes of the Crown, has helped to embolden the stability of the status quo. The truth is that Professor Shortwit has for decades been the architect of an uprising. An army of fearless empowered young women in waiting, courageous and ready at a moments notice to execute a coup upon the King."},{"name":"Erilar","genderRaceOccupation":"Headmistress, former Chair of Extraplanar Studies","description":" Erilar is a Tiefling sorcerer who devoted her life to studying the Great Old Ones. Unfortunately, they\u0027ve taken no notice of her - in a better world, she\u0027d be a warlock. Surprisingly, however, she is a genuinely good person. She believes that it is the duty of magic-users to improve the world around them and help others. How she imagines the Great Old Ones could possibly be part of this is anyone\u0027s guess."},{"name":"Godmund","genderRaceOccupation":"Vice-head of the University","description":" Godmund is a male human warlock. He wants quiet order. Nothing elaborate, just everything to work the way it should. He will gladly hand off tasks to someone else if that means he can handle more important things. He is an overweight, slightly balding man who wears a look of general frustration all the time. His robes are disheveled and generally in disarray, and he tends to look like he’s not had time to get dressed. His complexion is generally blotchy and red. He, too, is interested in the Great Old Ones, much to Erilar\u0027s frustration."},{"name":"Lota Riverbend","genderRaceOccupation":"Abjuration Studies (and dabbles in Conjuration)","description":" Lota is a female halfling, and is mainly motivated to prove herself. She takes mistakes very seriously, and will be much harder on herself than on others. Lota isn’t humorless, as she often feels the need to point out. She tells people that she likes to have fun, but no one has seen evidence of this. She needs to assert her power and her superiority, possibly because of being a Halfling. This strikes many people as odd, as Halflings are often very comfortable in who they are."},{"name":"Fingali","genderRaceOccupation":"Grimoierery and Spellbook Theory","description":" Fingali is a male human wizard who specializes in the construction and theory of spellbooks and grimoires. He\u0027s well-versed in bookbinding, calligraphy, and runic arts, and is constantly making and re-making his own spellbook to make it \"The best it\u0027s ever been.\" He has a very fine collection of old spellbooks. When - gods forbid - a fellow professor passes away, he has a very hard time holding back his urge to ransack the dead person\u0027s room. He has one book in his collection that he never shows anyone - the Black Grimoire of the Necromancer Tsyesende. It was thought lost, and he fears for his life if anyone should find out he has it. He is meticulous and detail-oriented, and has very little patience with sloppiness. Once his interest is piqued, however, he is unshakable."},{"name":"John Quimbly","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Runic Language","description":" John Quimbly is a human male, who due to his surprisingly short stature is often mistaken for a gnome. He has brown hair and a short busy beard and looks fairly young despite his receding hairline. Professor Quimbly is an expert in runic languages, having published various books on decoding them. Unfortunately for his students, sometimes, the professor swaps into the runic languages, in moments of excitement, forgetting that he is teaching about them, not discussing them with someone of his own expertise."},{"name":"Yagnar Orearm","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Metallurgy","description":" Yagnar Orearm is a Dwarf, very proud of being so, who teaches the science of metals: their properties, production, and purification in the Institute of Military Sciences in East Ravenheart. The Dwarf, grumpy and strict in nature, requires the absolute best from his students and accepts nothing but excellence on his examinations and practicum. However, many students report that outside of class, the dwarf makes a great advisor, for life and drink, and is an incredible arm wrestler. Once per term, the dwarf gives any student the chance to defeat him in an arm wrestling match in exchange for perfect marks on an examination. No student has ever conquered this challenge yet."},{"name":"Wingle Grimblesnout","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Olfaction","description":" Professor Grimblesnout could easily be mistaken for a dwarf or a gnome simply due to his incredibly small stature, and the fact that he is so bent over that his head is level with his chest. Having been in a family of alchymists he was introduced to the craft at a young age. He always had an impeccable sense of smell, and no one quite knew why. The reason behind this is that he was infected with Lycantrhpy Rota when he was a child. In the laymans terms, he is a rat lycan. Grimblesnout has quite the passion for smell. making sure that his students know the importance of knowing every regent in your laboratory by smell, he really revels in particular odours, some of them delightful, some of them less so. He is especially fascinated by powerful smells, whether it is the delightful aroma of an effervescent love potion. Or the overbowering stench of a troglodyte. Smells just fascinate him. He tends to forget that having Troglodyte extract shoved up your nose, doesn\u0027t really excite the students as much as it excites himself, and of course anyone lucky enough to be out of noseshot. Don\u0027t ask him what Olfaction is. In his eyes, the science of smell, is the groundwork to every other important science."},{"name":"Ved Sharpsnout","genderRaceOccupation":"Chair and founder of the Dept. of \"Traps and Other things Relating to Them,\" former Prof. of \"Home Defense Through Any Means\"","description":" None but the headmistress know how a lowly kobold managed to secure a position as a professor at the university, but here he stands, nonetheless. Ved is rather tall for a kobold, standing just over 3 feet in height, and is quite excitable. It is clear to any who take his classes that the kobold is passionate about his field, and from the testimony of those who have taken any of the scaly professor\u0027s classes, Ved is a surprisingly enjoyable teacher, who is genuinely invested in his students\u0027 works. While he isn\u0027t the most intelligent person in the world, he makes up for it with immense creativity and unwavering determination. Still, creativity and determination alone doesn\u0027t prevent the poor kobold from becoming the unfortunate victim of nearly all of the jerry-rigged traps he shows as an example to the class. Ved, along with a small following of his former students, were able to found a new department (which Ved personally named and is immensely proud of), with the headmistress\u0027s approval, in order to better inform future adventurers and dungeon-crafters alike about the intricacies of trap design."},{"name":"Cardon Coldsorrow","genderRaceOccupation":"The Scriptures of Jundard of the Sun","description":" Coldsorrow is half-orc Cleric of Jundard, a minor sun god with a small monastic community. The library is mainly full of scriptures collected from the few prophets the religion has gathered over the years, and it is Coldsorrow\u0027s dream to be able to compile them into a proper holy book. Until then, he seeks out visionaries and converts, and writes down every decision the head of his order makes, all in a hope of finding a unified dogma. He\u0027s unusually short for a Half-Orc, but solid, and his usually cheerful demeanor fades when he drinks. Before taking up the Clergy, he was a soldier in a failed war."},{"name":"Raxton Dafner","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of the Barbaric Arts","description":" Raxton is a Dwarf with an extraordinarily short temper, this has lead him into the Barbarian class where he has learned to control and manipulate his rage. Raxton is a mature balding Dwarf who has no time for messing around, when you are in his class he expects complete attention. Very often in his class you will be taken on \"field trips\" into the surrounding area where Raxton is known to rage and demonstrate his abilities to the class."},{"name":"Cormik Lash","genderRaceOccupation":"Actionable Artifice for the Active Adventurer","description":" Cormik is short even by rock gnome standards, reaching only 3 feet tall. However, he compensates for his short stature by standing and pacing on his paper strewn desk during lecture. Students have a hard time taking him seriously in his oil-stained trench coat, threadbare top hat, and obscenely unkempt handlebar mustache."},{"name":"Reese Wizardspoon aka Mr. Universe","genderRaceOccupation":"Greater Illusory Theory; Opening your Mind\u0027s Eye","description":" Reese is a rather young and out of place professor thrust into the spotlight by his elaborate illusions performed on the streets. His recent addition to the college does not sit well with many of the tenured professors who see him as a goth-dressed charlatan with the nonchalance of a spoiled brat. He is, in fact, all of those things."},{"name":"Osborn Goodbarrel","genderRaceOccupation":"History and Culture of Halfling Society","description":" For many years, Professor Goodbarrel taught the young Halflings in his burrow. However, many of his students have left the burrow to travel the world - the latest trend amongst adolescent Halflings. At the moment, Professor Goodbarrel enjoys teaching the few remaing youngsters, but he has considered going on a journey himself, to see what all the fuss is about."},{"name":"Faelen Leororis","genderRaceOccupation":"Former Professor of Poetic Studies, currently Head of the Drama Club","description":" Faelen Leororis taught poetry for many decades, and even though she was notorious for her high demands, her courses were actually quite popular. Her current project is the adaptation of a great Elven epic into a theater performance."},{"name":"Jofrit Windshield","genderRaceOccupation":"Social Studies and Philosophy","description":" Anyone who strays too close to \u0027Professor\u0027 Windshield\u0027s regular table at the \"Drunk Skunk\" will be immediately enter his \"School of Hard Knocks\". Here, he imparts on his more or less willing students the lessons he learned during his life. Students who are willing to give this perpetually drunken Dwarf a secod chance may, however, learn something more profound than they had expected."},{"name":"Terrence Fitterleigh","genderRaceOccupation":"Tenured Professor of Illusory Menageries","description":" For many years Terrence\u0027s lanky frame slumped behind a pulpit, shoulders sagging, eyelids drooping. He had been proclaimed a wunderkind in his field of illusion decades earlier, achieving in years what renowned elven wizards take decades to accomplish. It was only when he rediscovered his childhood dream of interacting with great, exotic beasts- and found he could, in his own way, bring them to life- that his love for his work was rekindled. He\u0027s currently attempting to create a complete set of parchment cards that will allow the animals to interact with each other- although once he\u0027s completed it, who knows what he\u0027ll do with it, and the tedium of academia will no doubt come crawling into his life again. I recently reread /u/LiberatedCapsicum \u0027s post on Magic the Cardening and I\u0027m looking for a way to squeeze it into my next campaign from the get-go. This seemed like a good fit!"},{"name":"Samuel Sodder","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Magical Herbology","description":" A hulking man who footsteps crash through the halls Samuel inspires fear in his students. This firebolg stands near 8 feet tall and usually carries with him at least one book for either pleasure reading, research, or class. New students fear him until they take his class however, then they understand he is a soft spoken, kindly individual. He understands that not all students have vast interest in the world of magical plants and their many beneficial properties but he never the less expects his students to try. His office equally suited for him. No desk, just several large bookshelves, a fire place and several squashy armchairs. Students who choose to come to his office hours can expect to be stuck in a lengthy chat for upwards of an hour for a simple question. His passion and appreciation for his subject is endless and he hopes to instill that in his students. As a result his students tend to try harder in his class, less out of interest in the class but more out of appreciation for the professor."},{"name":"Ortyn Lutraine","genderRaceOccupation":"Urban Demography: Race Relations in Novo Kharkus","description":" Skyrocketing to academic fame with his recent treatise on the use of human negotiators in tackling Dwarven gang wars, Ortyn Lutraine is the poster child of Altus University\u0027s Sociology Department. The young human is as often found sitting in on council meetings to advise on civil unrest issues as he is charming students in his lecture theatre: his foppish mop of brown hair, dazzling grin and red velvet waistcoat seem tailored to the latter, however. Flamboyant appearance aside, the Professor is an inspiring man, delivering impassioned speeches fluently in any of the five languages of Novo Kharkus. If anyone were to meticulously trace the sacks of gold allocated to Lutraine\u0027s field work, however, they would find substantial amounts in the hands of Dwarven militants and High Elven supremacists alike. Having stepped into the scholastic spotlight and enjoyed the perks it brings, Lutraine is remaining relevant for years to come..."},{"name":"Verisimilitude Merkins","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of the Illusionary Arts","description":" A handsome middle-aged male Tiefling who is a hit with most of the students and faculty. He is rumored to have crossed certain student-teacher boundaries more than a few times. Alumni of the schools he has taught at tend to develop arguments about what he looks like."},{"name":"Brinto","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Irritatingly Repetitive Melodies That Get Stuck In Your Head For Days And Just As you\u0027ve Forgotten About Them Someone Walks Past You Humming Them","description":" A balding, blonde, half-elf who is always under-dressed. Professor (\"Please, just Brinto\") Brinto is clearly something of an outsider to the faculty. He spends most of his time under the largest tree upon campus absentmindedly strumming his 9-string Lute. He never teaches formal classes, preferring instead to spend his time in one on one sessions with students he has dubbed \u0027visionaries\u0027. Murmurings amount the faculty suggest he was expelled from several bardic colleges and only retains a position at his current location because he holds knowledge over the Arch-Chancellor."},{"name":"Ruklau the Knobbed","genderRaceOccupation":"Experimental transmutation magic","description":" Short, ugly, misshapen fellow who looks a bit like a goblin crossed with a warthog crossed with a dirty leather knapsack. A tuft of black feathers juts out of his left eyebrow, and his right hand is a gnarled, arthritic claw. Despite his appearance, he is well-spoken and very articulate, and it\u0027s difficult to tell what his original race was. He doesn\u0027t seem the least bit concerned about his looks, and is certainly capable of changing his form, but no one knows why he chooses to look the way he does. He\u0027s always surrounded by the scent of aromatic pipesmoke, and particularly enjoys when the university chef prepares mutton stew."},{"name":"Rosaline DeVoute","genderRaceOccupation":"Woodworking and Survival Skills","description":" Rosaline is a tall and fragile woman. Standing at 6\u00273 she is very quick and nimble on her feet. Long white hair flows and borders her small fragile face. While she gives the cold shoulder to most, her students know her as a kind and gentle soul. She wishes only the best for her students and wants everyone to learn basic survival. While she loves the outdoors, nothing can be out of place."},{"name":"Avyer Thornen","genderRaceOccupation":"Royal Etiquette and Duties","description":" Avyer is an extremely proper (to the point of appearing snobbish) elf. This is largely due to his responsibility: Avyer has been the private tutor for more than a dozen generations of young human princes and princesses. Though he is mostly out of the picture by the time a ruler comes of age, Avyer is quite possibly the most powerful elf in the human kingdoms, and is always well regarded by his former pupils."},{"name":"Prestor Brine","genderRaceOccupation":"Non-mundane Animal Husbandry","description":" This professor is short-of-stature, with large gesticulations when recounting one of their countless stories on the field. Though they come across as blunt or loud to others, there is a quiet calmness when interacting with magical beasts. On both accounts, they are quick to attend to any action that subtle, passive aggressive, or \"raises flags\"."},{"name":"Milton Treadmoor","genderRaceOccupation":"Magic in Cosmetology: Skills, Theory, and Ethics","description":" This tenured elven professor has made a name for himself both in academia and business. No one is just quite sure how much of his work goes into his own flawless appearance, but many pranks of Dispel Magic have not yet revealed the answer. Despite the foppish demeanor, he is utterly serious about his work and refuses to teach anyone less dedicated. There are rumors that he wants to establish his own dedicated beautician school."},{"name":"Frida Darringer","genderRaceOccupation":"TA, Primordial 101","description":" She is a gifted tiefling with a fear of public speaking. Not that she is in public much; she tends to be deep in research or doing work for colleagues she was too meek enough to refuse. Her favorite activity is talking at length to students about shared interests."},{"name":"Hamish","genderRaceOccupation":"ninja edit","description":" An aged human with fading white hair and a tranquil presence. He is not a conventional professor, certainly not by trade. The most detailed of his past is that of a retired adventurer\u0027s, who ended a bout of globetrotting at the University he now resides in. Though he never speaks of his adventuring days, whatever he experienced doubtlessly impacted the man\u0027s mission to help the mentally-affected. It is also thought to have impacted his own sanity as well..."},{"name":"Hermann Kremmler","genderRaceOccupation":"Dean of Arcanarcheology","description":" Kremmler is an old human man with a bent back and thinning grey hair, fond of wearing patterned skullcaps to cover his head. He is ornery and grumpy at the best of times, but he is also one of the leading experts on magical items from previous civilizations. In spite of his advanced age, his general style of teaching is to bring students along to ruins and dungeons and lecture in between traps being sprung and skeletons coming to life. Some have accused him of using his students as expendable fodder so he can make more discoveries, but his fellow staff are willing to overlook any \"accidental\" deaths so long as his discoveries bring the university acclaim and funding."},{"name":"Johan Alkenstav","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Religious Artifacts","description":" A musclebound human man who would honestly look more at home in a gladiatorial pit than a classroom, Alkenstav\u0027s gregarious attitude draws in students from all over the university. He works closely with the local clergy to identify magical items of a divine origin and is remarkably open-minded in terms of religion, even collaborating with followers of faiths looked down upon in the city. This has caused him no end of trouble, but a combination of tenure and an odd friendship with Hermann Kremmler have kept him employed and teaching."},{"name":"Alienor Serre","genderRaceOccupation":"Visiting Professor of Underdark Botany and Medicine","description":" Serre is an elven woman visiting from one of the forest enclaves. She keeps her platinum blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, her face set in a polite but cold expression. She doesn\u0027t speak much of her time back in the enclaves, but many suspect that she was a slave that escaped the drow before she became a visiting professor at the university. Those who believe this theory point to her area of expertise and how much she knows of the medicinal properties of the various fungi and lichens endemic to the Underdark. Serre remains silent on the subject."},{"name":"Instructor Aamin Marritza","genderRaceOccupation":"Proper Filing Systems and Book Keeping in the Military","description":" Marritza is a grey scaled Yuan-Ti Mallison (Type 1) who served in the military as a filing clerk. He was regarded as a superb military employee and his filing system was considered a masterpiece of meticulous exactitude. In all his years he never lost a single file and was offered a post at the military academy as an instructor to teach filing. He is very punctual, very thorough and very, very orderly. A single pencil out of place is almost insulting to him, a messy desk almost incorrigibly barbaric. Beyond that he is a very patriotic but also very moral man with no taste for torture, senseless killing and cruelty of any kind. In private he has uttered misgivings about past conflicts and the war crimes commited during those. His current location is unknown."},{"name":"Merrik Thicktail","genderRaceOccupation":"Taxonomy and Gastronomy of Swamp Creatures, Great and Small","description":" Merrik is of average height, but his course of study and eating habits keep him as close to obese and any lizardfolk can be. The course (known to students as \"T and G\") is a field study of fauna of a local swamp where Merrik and students learn to classify several species of creatures ranging from dragonflies to alligators and learn preparation techniques for several \u0027cultural delicacies\u0027 of the lizardfolk tribe that inhabits the swamp. Field gear and anti-acids recommended and additional fees may be charged for spices."},{"name":"Rogo Morihei","genderRaceOccupation":"Philosophy \u0026 Martial Wisdom","description":" Morihei is an aged male Dragonborn with narrow eyes and faded silver scales. He wears a long, stiff beard and loose, simply adorned robes. His bushy whiskers extend low, blending seamlessly with his white beard. \"The Way of the Warrior has been misunderstood. It is not a means to kill and destroy others. Those who seek to compete and better one another are making a terrible mistake. To smash, injure, or destroy is the worst thing Dragonkind can do. The real Way of a Warrior is to prevent such slaughter - it is the Art of Peace, the power of love.\""},{"name":"Quintus Epicurus","genderRaceOccupation":"Arch-Mage of The Geddaye Order, and Professor of Advanced Classified Arcana","description":" Arch-Mage Quintus is an innocuous looking human man of about 60 years. He wears the same indigo robes and enormously wide brimmed black hat everyday. He allows them to grow dingier with each passing day, despite having the ability to simply prestidigitate them into perfect condition with the snap of his fingers. Being too busy for even that, Quintus has a multitude of better ways to spend his time and he keeps track of all of them in his head. Well .... almost all of them. He often forgets about his \"Classified Arcana\" class when his attention is on important research. In fact, he only shows up to about a third of the classes, much to the chagrin of his peers in the College of Geddaye. He is supremely gifted in his intuition of Arcane arts, having mastered all 5 schools in only 30 years of study. There are whispers amongst the senior members that Quintus should be removed from the post of Arch-Mage in favor of someone with more... experience. After all, Quintus is the first Human to run the Geddaye in a millennia."},{"name":"Evelyn Nate","genderRaceOccupation":"Conjuration and Infernal Studies","description":" Professor Nate appears as a stern woman, wih sharp features that seem just on the cusp of middle age. She is known as a harsh but fair teacher, and anyone who gets top marks in her class is considered a rising star at the school. While she doesn\u0027t appear particularly old, the school records indicate she taught many famous wizards who are well into their old age, or even dead many years. Her seemingly wternal youth is the source of much speculation among students, ranging from an infernal pact, to being a pit fiend disguised as a mortal woman."},{"name":"Philister Carnival","genderRaceOccupation":"Artifact crafting","description":" Well known to academia as a master of his craft, he is also well known among his local peers as \"The Childish Professor\". While his perpetual enthusiasm is on first meeting intoxicating, his often meandering trains of thought, unrestrained manners and know-it-all arrogance can become tiresome if no-one is there to keep him in check. While many can criticize his person, nobody can deny that it is his odd imagination that has allowed him to make many advances in the field of magical items. Most of his students just study from the textbook."},{"name":"Grace Akita","genderRaceOccupation":"Tea-making","description":" While her course is often joked to be \"caveman\u0027s potion-maker\", the art of making tea is one that teaches less of the substances that are produced and more of simple meditation. Nobody has ever heard her raise her voice louder than necessary, and she is known for having the patience of a statue. Her lessons often stick with her students and show through in other fields such as advanced magika, fine arts and politics. When she is not teaching, she can be found meditating in her classroom with a hot kettle nearby for anyone who wishes to join her."},{"name":"Elyseus Longgrass","genderRaceOccupation":"are","description":" In all of the courses he teaches, he is praised by the students for his performence capabilities, and for the ability to explain difficult things in simple terms.

A very charismatic dreamboat. It seems he is friends with everyone: students, faculty and beyond. Seen from the outside, the devotion he inspires actually seems a bit creepy and might lead one to suspect him of using his powers for evil. In actuality Valentin is just a really nice person to be around. He isn\u0027t even that good an enchanter, but have gotten promoted again and again, due to how much the head of the university likes him. He doesn\u0027t think he deserves the position, but he doesn\u0027t want to embarrass his friend, so he just does his best. Though, at least the students love him, and his underlings do their best to cover for their beloved dean."},{"name":"Tryskin Bridgetpants","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Applied Life Sciences and Regeneration","description":" Professor Tryskin is an energetic gnome with a short stature, an impressive moustache and an eternal love for his field. If you get him talking, you\u0027ll be hard pressed to get him to stop talking, as he wanders from subject to subject to off-kilter tangent. It is a moderately well kept secret that Tryskin is working on a cloning program to allow certain individuals of wealth and power to survive in a new body, if they should suffer an accident with their old one. It is a secret known only to the clone masquerading as Tryskin that the real Tryskin has been on vacation for the past seven months. The clone is getting worried, since Tryskin really should have been back by now."},{"name":"Crael Dusken","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Heraldry","description":" An unassuming, mousy woman with long blond hair, Crael loves the study of Heraldry and the study of noble lineages. She hates students. She hates people asking her questions. If everyone would just leave her alone to her studies everyone would be much better off. Her colleagues have taken to borrow scrolls and books from her extensive collection to answer questions for inquiring souls, rather than subject them to her acerbic personality."},{"name":"Durkin Trollkiller","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Monstrous Metahumans","description":" This stout dwarf with the big bushy black beard has found a new profession after his previous one as a monster hunter. He doesn\u0027t have any particular love for the subject, but he has learned a lot about it by necessity, and has found that the career as a professor is less dangerous than his previous one. He does need to stop filling half his class room time with anecdotes, if he wants to keep the position."},{"name":"Professor Hornsby","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Archaeology and Ancient Artifice","description":" Professor Hornsby is a typical dottering academic who loves to dig through ancient ruins to unearth ancient artifacts. He specializes in ancient writing, especially arcane runes, scrolls, and diagrams for lost magical constructs. Although he loves digging through ruins, he is rarely prepared for the dangers of what has since taken up residence, having no adventuring experience. His studies have taught him to cast up to third level spells, but he mostly prepares spells to help in his studies more than in combat, like Gust of Wind to clear sand from a ruined tablet."},{"name":"Kimri Godsblade","genderRaceOccupation":"Dwarven Historian","description":" Descended from a family of faithful Paladins of Moradin, Kimri bucked tradition a bit by becoming a scholar. She still retains some of the faith and training her parents instilled in her, but now she focuses on traveling the world to collect the histories of dwarvenkind from all kinds of isolated villages, from the lowlands to the hills to the swamps, in the hope of piecing together the true origin of her dwarves and publishing it in her magnum opus."},{"name":"Quilton Maxim","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Physics","description":" A devout, human professor who spends much of his time on his research and experimenting, however in truth, and it is known to his colleagues, he is a remarkably unremarkable individual. Having short brown hair and glasses while always wearing dull clothing, he has not contributed anything of note to the department or to his students, boring most of his students to death with pointless lectures. He does however, spend much of his time in the canyon near town observing rocks fall."},{"name":"Babus Turalius","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Archaeology and Language","description":" An old, renowned Dwarven hero who adventured the lands in his youth, Babus now teaches at Zarditar\u0027s University of Magic. He has long, gray hair that matches his equally long beard, and has a large, muscular figure. He loves to take his students to primary sites of research, such as abandoned ruins or excavation sites, and give them real-hand experience with the subject, something he believes is invaluable. He is known for his quirky, circular glasses that he always wears."},{"name":"Dianne LeMont","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Alchemy","description":" Dianne LeMont is an elegant woman from an exotic country. She has a sharp face, platinum blonde hair, and piercing, icy blue eyes. Her specialization is Alchemy, with specific interest in extracting the poison of Arachnids. Because of this fascination, she has a hidden closet dedicated to Spiders, including a full-body latex spider suit..."},{"name":"Captain Onestorm","genderRaceOccupation":"Tactical Training for Battlefield Combat","description":" Battle-worn, scarred and broken, but still as thick as a tree. Longor Onestorm, Captain to his students, The Hammers of Windspire to many songs and scrolls, has never lost his great courage, or his mirthful spirit. Great physical strength borne of a hard-scrabble childhood, the man is broad and tall. Having spent many years at war, he has lost much and yet he is always genial and full of hopeful optimism. Those he prepares for battle take away much more than skill in the art of melee. They learn from Longor the value in seeing each enemy as more than a monster, in imagining him complexly and understanding that his conviction is as great as their own. And, in the end, having the courage still to kill him in service to the cause; this, Longor holds, is true nobility."},{"name":"Kroggar Thindleburn","genderRaceOccupation":"Visiting professor of Survival Among Larger Folk","description":" Kroggar is an odd appearance in civilized society as he is a red kobold and insists on wearing clothing that accentuates his figure and natural beauty as he puts it and while some my find him unappealing there is no disputing he is an expert in his field. He is middle aged for a kobold and often shows disdain towards the larger races while assisting the smaller folk who take his classes. Kroggar treads a close line as he has been brought up to the university board a number times for down marking the taller of the humans and elves that take his class and passing failing shorter students."},{"name":"Zachariah MacRuaidri","genderRaceOccupation":"Professor of Demonology and Abyssal Linguistics","description":" Narrow-build and towering over most of his students and fellow professors, Xanthras is an individual of very few words and even fewer public appearances. When he does interact with others, the albino speaks his mind and with only the bare-bones of syntactical structure to get his point across as quick and simple as possible. When he doesn\u0027t teach his admittedly quite small courses on psyionics, he keeps to the university archives and tends to the tens of thousands of books with almost feverish tenacity and fanatic devotion - often not so subtly threatening painful, sometimes even lethal consequences to any fool who might damage one of the precious scrolls or almanacs. Most of the student body, and quite a few of his colleagues are relieved that he mostly keeps to the library. After all, even to the most seasoned of adventurers and arcanists, an honest to the gods Illithid can and will invoke a feeling of unsettling dread - even if he wears a professor\u0027s robes. With his fiery hair, sunken-in green eyes, pointed nose and lanky stature, Zachariah resembles more a crazed, animated scarecrow than a regular human being, and is known for his snide, with colloquialism and broad accent-riddled remarks and the sheer limitless supply of whiskey he is somehow able to pull from the insides of his coat. It is universally agreed on that the only reason he has not been kicked out of the university yet, is the fact that 1) despite his eccentrism and occasional spouts of jackassery, he is a very dedicated and capable teacher, 2) he possesses vast and intricate knowledge of the Abyss and its inhabitants, no doubt related to the warlock\u0027s fiendish patron, and 3) he proved himself to be absolutely willing to put an accidentally released glabrezu in a headlock if it meant protecting his students."},{"name":"\u0027Art\u0027 Damakos","genderRaceOccupation":"potent","description":" Edit: Some spelling."},{"name":"Bezeldore the Blue","genderRaceOccupation":"Hydromancy and the Finer Aspects of Bathing","description":" A bright-eyed, portly gnome with a welcoming smile and a light blue beard that is dyed regularly to retain its lustre. He is usually dressed in dirty, smeared robes and is always accompanied by an imp named Selimvad who carries Bezeldore\u0027s books. When not lecturing classes at The Starry Wisdom School for the Gifted, he can be found sculpting ice statues, reading a lengthy tome or performing short plays in the city square with his ice constructs."},{"name":"Shanu the Binder","genderRaceOccupation":"Strategic Enchantment and War-scrying","description":" Shanu is a slender dryad with a surprising affinity for studied magic and the nature of war. How she can live so far from her tree is likely beyond anyone\u0027s guess, but her mysterious green robes may have something to do with it — not that she\u0027d give a straight answer if one were to ask. She is usually pleasant when meeting new people, but suffers no fools. She is particularly protective of her students at The Auerbach Circle Institute (\u0027saplings\u0027 as she affectionately refers to them) and will not hesitate to dispatch anyone who appears to be a threat to the school."},{"name":"Lorne Proudstump","genderRaceOccupation":"Herbalism Professor","description":" Dirt on his coat, moss on his hat, and a smile that seldom leaves his face, Professor Proudstump is often a pupils favourite. Small, even for a gnome, he radiates an upbeat energy, genuinely in love with his field of study and eager to pass that love on. He is often seen trying to convince some of the more magically inclined staff to teleport him to other planes, in hopes of getting new and exciting \u0027friends\u0027. He does not abide people treating his plants poorly, and will threaten to prune the fingers of students who do so. It has only happened twice, and its rumored if he snips a third finger, he will be fired."},{"name":"Fonix the Barbarian","genderRaceOccupation":"crash courses on Goliath cuisine","description":" Fonix is a male goliath with deep green piercing eyes, extremely pragmatic, he with zeal tries the best to cook and eat the inedible, he dreams to one day be able cook even the common pebble into a dish worthy of the gods, cries if in the presence of anyone noticeably hungry."},{"name":"Gertrude Rosenburger","genderRaceOccupation":"Spell Pronunciation 101","description":" Gertrude always speaks with perfect enunciation, to the point that it is almost annoying how much she will slow down multi-syllabic words in order to emphasize certain parts. Gertrude is an elf with a very pronounced pair of lips. When she is not speaking actively, they are puckered. She wears a black gown and carries several of what she calls \"dud\" spell components for teaching class."},{"name":"Jarl Goondugg","genderRaceOccupation":"Somatic Components for Basic Spellcasting","description":" Jarl is a decrepit tiefling who wears a series of hats with holes for his curved, black horns. He has light purple skin, and wears a series of decorative bracelets a la Johnny Depp. Jarl is but 3 months away from retirement, and it definitely shows in how much his hands shake. The tremors in his hands (due to his age) have a way of twisting the spells he teaches, much to the dismay of his cautious students."},{"name":"Leowick Hieg","genderRaceOccupation":"Weaving","description":" This grizzled old man sports a beard that gets shorn, like his sheep, twice a year. He is patient and enjoys the company of people, but is slow to trust. He keeps a ledger with records of whom he owes favors to, but does not track the favors he is owed. He teaches courses in animal husbandry, and his pupils learn the skill of making cloth starting from the birth of a lamb. Only the most advanced students are allowed access to the workshop with the looms."},{"name":"Melinda Court","genderRaceOccupation":"Philosophy","description":" Melinda is a tall human woman in her sixties with very dark skin, her graying hair tied back in many small braids, then gathered in a bun. Her wrists clatter with wooden jewelry, and she\u0027s always accompanied by the scent rose perfume. She can be found around campus on sunny days, lounging in the grass with her students as they discuss ethical theory and the nature of truth as equals. In her spare time, she secretly publishes controversial anarchist pamphlets under the pseudonym \u0027A Thoughtful Lady\u0027, where she calls for the end of all social hierarchies."},{"name":"Arelias Verisaren","genderRaceOccupation":"Elven Studies","description":" Arelias is a slight high elf clad in colorful silk scarfs, with long silver hair and brows arched in an expression of wry amusement. He specializes in contemporary northern high elf poetry and the Elvish language, but as his university\u0027s token elf, he has diversified to teach classes on elven history, culture, and religion. With a dry wit and cynical sense of humor, Arelias is popular among his students, less so among his fellow staff. The students he develops close relationships with tend to confide in him, and he knows all manner of secrets. Arelias is married to the dwarven professor of history, Korren Silvervein, and the two can often be seen observing, assisting, and substituting in one another\u0027s classes."},{"name":"Korren Silvervein","genderRaceOccupation":"History","description":" Korren is well-built dwarf under is his tailored suits, his dark hair neatly trimmed, with olive colored eyes that beam benevolently from behind a pair of half-moon spectacles. He teaches the history of several civilizations, particularly that of human and dwarven kingdoms. Korren has a fatherly air, with a patient but serious manner that makes students inclined to please him. More than a few envied historical tomes and artifacts are secreted away in his personal collection. Korren is married to the elven professor of elven studies, Arelias Verisaren, and the two can often be seen observing, assisting, and substituting in one another\u0027s classes."},{"name":"Theda Norwood","genderRaceOccupation":"Physics and Chemistry","description":" One of the few faculty members at her university whose subject does not deal with the arcane, Theda has throughout her career been passionate about the value of learning about the universe(s) through a physical, rather than magical, lens. She is a short, good-natured human woman whose hands are perpetually stained with various chemicals, and she\u0027ll be perfectly willing to talk for hours about the recent scientific advances in the study of motion and the behavior of gases. She\u0027s very easily excited, and loves to learn."},{"name":"Sage Octavia Nymphidia","genderRaceOccupation":"Headmistress, formerly Application of Magical Theory: Advanced Transmutation","description":" A tall, poised, and long-suffering sun elf, Octavia was one of the most stern transmutation professors at Hellenes University. Tardiness is not tolerated except in the case of major injury, malady, or magical mishap. Her exam practicums also had a reputation for being exceedingly difficult. Even as headmistress, she continues to tolerate no shenanigans from students, and only barely from certain faculty members. The root of this sternness is her omnipresent no-nonsense seriousness. Normally this would be intimidating, but Octavia\u0027s possibly subconscious penchant for theatrics makes it quite comical. Not that anybody will say it to her face, of course, but the \"Octavia the Bard\" can be heard in whispers about her from students and faculty alike."},{"name":"Gavin Megarit","genderRaceOccupation":"Herbalism, Alchemy, and creation of useable consumables","description":" He is broad and imposing. Prefers to dress in work clothing and avoids fancy, formal outfits. His classes are fast-paced and students are often challenged to keep up. He is a great teacher for those students who have an inclination for the fields, but has no time or patience for those who have trouble following along. His homework assignments are in-depth to say the least; some former students have claimed to have PTSD from his assignments."},{"name":"Professor Windil Bimbleton","genderRaceOccupation":"Head Researcher Of Positive Energy","description":" An eccentric hafling that stands three and a half feet tall. He is high energy which he always claims is a result of the miracle working properties of positive energy. He has knowledge about the plane, substance, and spiritual nature of positive energy. He can go on for hours about the stuff. If asked he can provide accurate information about negative energy as well but doesn\u0027t seem as passionate about it. He also has a collection of manuscripts he wrote himself on varying subjects all some how tying into positive energy. One of his more unusual beliefs is that positive energy is the substance that makes up souls and therefore is part of the natural procreation cycle of all life."},{"name":"Ermgurd Longbreath","genderRaceOccupation":"Head Researcher Of Negative Energy","description":" Ermgurd is the head researcher of negative energy at the same university as Windil. She is a slightly short half orc woman. She has a heavy fatigued brow and she rarely expresses much emotion. She can answer almost any question about negative energy, undead, the plane of negative energy/shadowfell, or necromancy. She doesn\u0027t talk much and barely holds conversation. She has an odd yet understandable friendship with Windil. They work fairly closely."},{"name":"Melkin Vasnin","genderRaceOccupation":"Head Of Extra Planar Studies","description":" A gaunt half-elf male with a narrow face. He talks with sophistication and uses as many big words as he can. Some times he makes up new words when he feels that he can\u0027t express something with normal ones. He has knowledge about planar things. His focus is usually on the upper planes (Heaven, Utopia, etc.) although he can help with any plane. The more obscure the plane is the more he avoids talking about it. He believes all planes are just a strange demiplane of some greater plane. Every plane is encompassed by a bigger plane. He points to the Astral Sea and other such large planes as a good example."},{"name":"Kraddic Cobbhearth","genderRaceOccupation":"Philosophy of Babarianism","description":" Professor Cobbhearth is a halfling of middle age, with all the youth and vigor of one much younger. Built lean with a deep chest and broad shoulders he has strong arms and powerful legs. He is cagey and gleeful in his ferocity and he has a deep and impassioned reverence for primal rage, an emotion that he believes to be the only authentic thing a true warrior can feel in battle. While those raised in barbarian tribes either do not take to contemplative endeavors, or follow those endeavors far and away from the barbaric battle arts, Kraddic Cobbhearth embraced and enjoined the two. A professor keen on active praxis over hollow pontificating, his classroom is in the field. He is glad for his tenure as a professor, and has great respect for those students who veer from the traditional barbarian path into his class and into the underexplored study of barbaric philosophy. You can see him most days in the yard, his bald head bobbing and weaving around training weapons, and his great copper mustache, reaching to his knees and bedecked in gems and rings and bones, swaying as he deftly moves. Many years of deeply philosophical self-reflection has given Kraddic a level of emotional control uncommon among barbarians, fortunately for his students as his prowess in battle is surpassed only by a very few great dwarves and orcs of legend."},{"name":"Percival Sparktrap","genderRaceOccupation":"Archaeology \u0026 the Study of Ancient Civilizations","description":" Percy is a middle aged gnome of roughly three feet five inches who wears spectacles at all times and sports a rather haggard looking beard that\u0027s never quite filled out. He has tired, sorrowful eyes having seen many friends come and go all the while handling the stresses of working in some of the most dangerous locations in the world. He is a man of science and learning is his driving passion, even when it gets him into trouble. He and his wife Tilde are field researchers who lead expeditions for the Gnomish Research Academy and Museum (or GRAM for short, pun intended). Unfortunately, his risk-prone lifestyle has caught up with him and Percy now bears very serious scars over the right side of his head and shoulders where he was caught in the blast of a stray Fireball."},{"name":"Jhoira Douglass (neé Teamorr)","genderRaceOccupation":"Advanced Alchemical and Mechanical Artifice","description":" Jhoira is a female human wizard around 35 years of age. She was dropped off at the Academy at the age of 8, and excelled in her studies to the point where she was asked to stay on as a professor after graduation. As such she has not left the academy town in 24 years. For her dissertation, Jhoira \"gave life\" to several humanoid constructs that now inhabit the town around the academy and pioneered the field of alchemical artifice. Her life revolves around academia and has an almost visceral distaste for small-talk. [DM\u0027s note: if a PC asks her about anything other than her or her husband\u0027s research you should answer whimperingly and in as few words as possible]. However, when speaking about her or her husband\u0027s research her gregarious, bubbly, passionate personality shines through."},{"name":"Tavish Douglass","genderRaceOccupation":"Rare and Ancient Languages","description":" Tavish is an Elvish (raised by humans) Fighter-Wizard who\u0027s 342 years on this world have been filled with a few too many adventures. Over the course of his adventuring has learned nearly every language (he only knows insults in undercommon but claims that is all one needs to know). He retired from adventuring after losing his right leg and left arm protecting a nearby town from an ancient blue dragon 10 years ago. He now has mechanical limbs (of equal - perhaps greater - strength and dexterity to his previous limbs) made by Jhoira. He is a truly magnanimous individual and is the most energetic individual in every room that he is in. He misses adventuring but has accepted that his mechanical appendages require too much care for him to ever adventure again. Because of this, he loves to live vicariously through the lives and stories of any adventurers he comes across."},{"name":"Who are these merry magic-makers?","genderRaceOccupation":"The pretty little thing smiles as she beckons you onward along the narrow trail, swaying back and forth suggestively as she flies. You know you should follow the main path, but there something about her that you can\u0027t resist...","description":" Between here and /r/DMAcademy, there seems to have been a small run on Feywild posts of late. So let\u0027s populate some faerie forests with faeriefolk—pixies, sprites, nixies, nymphs, satyrs, you-name-it. I love pixies and sprites a bit too much, even in a dark, low-magic world, a region of a forest where there is a small community of tiny faeries is a grand opportunity to inject some wonder and to cause light-hearted trouble for the big folk. And, a faerie village can serve as a hub for NPCs, plot hooks, and small-scale supplies in regions of the world that is largely devoid of civilization. The NPCs don\u0027t have to be developed deeply, but they should have enough suggested content that any DM could quickly fill in what\u0027s missing."},{"name":"Meliorn of the Unseelie Court","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Archfey Lord","description":" Platinum blond hair, bright blue eyes, pale skin, wearing spider-silk garments fit for Llolth, emblazoned with gems that gleam like star light. Meliorn is a schemer- calm, patient, and seductive in his ways. Among other archfey, he\u0027s not particularly strong, but he seeks power through mortal achievement. He\u0027s been known to cut deals with the unwary and the desperate, and will send false-prophets into the world that can grant \u0027wishes\u0027 to the common folk in exchange for a favor in the future. Meliorn collects and saves these favors. To his debtors, these favors are an unbreakable obligation, which carry on into the afterlife."},{"name":"Whit Wrencaller","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Pixie Woodcarver","description":" Whit makes carved wooden curiosities—mostly toys and book ends. He makes a fair number of flutes and recorders, but if you want a real treat, you\u0027ll catch him while he has one of his fiddles in stock. A perfectionist, Whit trashes nine out of every ten fiddles he starts making. If you\u0027re lucky, you\u0027ll catch him when he breaks out his own tiny fiddle. When his nimble hand dances across the fingerboard, you can\u0027t help but tap your toes and take up the dance too."},{"name":"Daisy Dewpetal","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Pixie Landlady/Barmaid","description":" Daisy is cute as a button with iridescent red hair, pouty lips, and golden wings. Daisy runs the Twig and Thistle Inn. She serves some mighty fine pixiewine, and when she dances, you can\u0027t help but watch her sway. Her dancing is full of sorrow and passion. Daisy doesn\u0027t smile near as much as she used. She\u0027s been running the inn on her own since her partner Glip met an unfortunate end."},{"name":"Old Fox Featherbee","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Sprite Fletcher","description":" Fox fixes feathers of free-range forest fowl to his fine, finished arrows. Fox makes both large arrows and small arrows. His work is of such quality, several of the wood elves have been known to purchase arrows from Fox. Old Fox loves to talk about his adventures in the forest and never misses a chance to tell the tale of how he came to have that broken wing (it is quite an amusing tale involving an ogre, an elf-maid, and a magic mushroom)."},{"name":"Buck Boughbender","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Sprite Bowyer","description":" Across the way from Old Fox, you\u0027ll meet Buck the Bowyer. He makes decent bows, but he\u0027s not strong enough to string up bows for the big folk. He\u0027ll bend your ear regarding the most recent mischief happening at Madame Poppy\u0027s place in the pixie town over yonder. Buck\u0027s known to be found in his cups, tangled up with one or another of Poppy\u0027s girls. People say Madame Poppy owes him some sort of debt of gratitude, so she lets him have a \"special discount\" when he visits."},{"name":"Poppy Plumdiddle","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Pixie Madame","description":" Blue-winged and fair-haired, Madame Poppy runs the House of Li\u0027l Repute where all the girls are petite and dusty-eyed. All the girls are faeries of course. They can fiddle and dance and make romance though their methods are a little creative to overcome the mechanical challenges of entertaining big men. Madame Poppy puts on a polite and innocent face, but she knows exactly what she\u0027s doing. The girls still chatter and wonder about the time Madame Poppy single-handedly sent a hobgoblin captain and two of his lieutenants off into smiling just a few short minutes after they had squashed poor Glip Pinesap and were threatening to carve up the whole town."},{"name":"Roan Daar, Lord of the Sweeping Fen","genderRaceOccupation":"Male archfey","description":" A minor archfey, Roan Daar nevertheless possesses a full measure of the pride and fickleness inherent in the faerie folk. He takes the form of a tall, impossibly thin humanoid figure, with a reedy voice and deep-set golden eyes, often wearing long robes of woven swamp-grass and lined with cattail-fur. Those trespassing in his swampy domain are often sucked under, only to be returned to the surface unharmed years later. He counts many will-o-the-wisps as his children, and they will often surround him wherever he appears."},{"name":"Ezel Broadcap","genderRaceOccupation":"Male killoren artificer","description":" A skilled artificer of no small renown. He can be identified by his clothing first and foremost; a wide-brimmed, pointed hat that seems to be made of frost-covered twigs and small branches, a loose-fitting tunic made from spring shoots and new growth, and trousers woven from fallen autumn leaves. He bears a simple staff, as well. Ezel is brusque and mostly concerned with his own projects, the archetypical preoccupied wizard. Most of his work, however, goes into making small objects and trinkets to make life a little easier for those who discover them. A pouch of small rocks that transmute themselves into silver pieces, which refills each dusk; a willow-twig ring that rustles like wind when danger approaches; a kettle that perfectly seasons any food placed inside."},{"name":"Pox Petaldew","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Pixie Police Commissioner","description":" Kin to the respected Dewpetal pixie clan, Commisioner Petaldew is charged with keeping the peace in the Faerie Wood. He is short-tempered and high strung. He is possibly the only Pixie angry enough to use foul language, though who can blame him? Between the the threat of goblin loggers, lost adventurers, and feuding Faun clans, someone has got to maintain order in the Faerie Wood."},{"name":"Sel\u0027adrin Grintooth","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Faerie Dragon Trickster","description":" Lives in a secluded forest mostly burned down by Gnolls.

He spends his day following random strangers on their trips and eats their food and drink their wine in return for random falls facts about the area."},{"name":"Glitterball","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Pixie Trickster","description":" She is all about turning people into butterflies. The first time people are aware of her is when one of their number suddenly disappears and a floating, winged flier takes their place.

His objectives are a secret he will keep till death and failure is never an option."},{"name":"Delia Firenut","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Sprite Singer","description":" Delia is usually dressed in short yellow dress made up of autumn leaves, and has her naturally red hair tied in a ponytail. As most faeries, she too is curious about humans, but at the same time keeps a distance from them, secretly believing that fey are superior to the mortal races. She was singer until the moment her voice was stolen by unseelie satyr."},{"name":"Sargaritis","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Nymph Arcanist","description":" Her hair the color of hazelnut usually sticks to her seductive face since it\u0027s always wet, just as her white dress. Being an intelligent fey, she sprinkles her speech with occasional eloquent word that would seem out of place for an unseelie nymph. She likes to tease mortal men, prefering humans and halflings and trying to drown them in her home lake as a joke. Even though its touch doesn\u0027t have any effect on her, she is disgusted by the idea of her or her home lake coming in contact with cold iron. Deep in her home lake, she hides a little cavern with several books about magic and the nature of weave she likes to read in her spare time."},{"name":"Naroth","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Centaur Warrior","description":" Serving his seelie queen as best as he can, Naroth seems to be black mustang from the waist down, and handsome muscular elf from the waist up. Always ready to fight, he is never seen in public without his specially fitted armor and his lance made of gold and silver. He is courageous, but as it often is said - the line between courage and stupidity is often very thin.

She uses this power largely to bully and humiliate travellers in her forest, turning them around, pulling them back, and simply trying to prove the forests dominance over them as she fancies herself a minor ruler.

Riding at the head of the Wild Hunt, The Huntmaster takes delight in every second of his dangerous pursuits, for his existence derives off living along the edge where bravery meets recklessness. Sources cannot agree on his motives or his actions. His goals are his own, but if one were to bargain with the Archfey they best appeal to his competitive and eager nature. By no means does that mean he is easy to fool, as he has the instinct of an apex predator."},{"name":"Flaherty","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dryad Minor Noble","description":" A minor noble in the Seelie Court and the brother of Jirvel. He leads a live of luxury in the giant oak in the middle of the glade he calls his domain. This glade is about one acre in size and can only be reached during the twilight hours before dusk and left during the twilight hours after dawn. If somebody gets trapped in the glade by not leaving before sunrise, he offers to let them stay the day in his oak, in exchange for a small favour in the future. If the person agrees this is a binding magical contract that can only be lifted by both parties agreeing to lift it. Other fey generally recognise his claim on the glade and the minor fey living in it adress him as Lord of the Glade and pay tribute to him in the form of minor gifts, which allows him to live his livestlye. In return he takes his promise to protect the glade and all that live in it very seriously. The only thing that means more to Flaherty then the glade and it\u0027s inhabitants is his younger sister Jirvel. She is his shining star, his rising sun, his scarlet poppy, something he is very eager to everybody that would listen. He has in fact been spending the last few years looking for a fitting husband, but in his eyes nobody is good enough for his darling sister. You can imagine his suprise when his sister returned from one of her trips in the company of a 1000 years old oak that one of her druid friends had cast awaken on and declared him her fiance. Flaherty, at first reluctant, has by now warmed up to the idea and has been busy with the preparations for the wedding. He has spared no expenses and even called in a lot of favours for this occasion, nothing is too good his sisters wedding. Because of this the wedding will be the most lavish and extravagant thing the forrest has ever seen (flowers from all over the world both as decoration and food for the smaller fey, will-o-wisps captured and stuffed into lantern that float through the air, a satyr band, a fountain of the best wine), and there will be a lot of different guests that traveled from long and far to attend the wedding. (Not only fey, but hags, human nobles, gnomish sages, sentient animals, even some elementals and minor celestials, but anybody is welcome really) If the players arive at the glave it is actually the night of the wedding and they can see the lights and hear the music from anywhere on the glade. Secrets: The giant oak he lives in is actually his bound tree and not only that but it is actually a treant that he merged with centuries ago. They share one mind and if somebody or something threatens the glade the two will merge and the oak will rise and defend it. While merged the two count as one creature, use the Treant statblock, but with a dryads metal stats, skills, innate spellcasting and magic resistance. During the wedding of his sister Flaherty is actually unable to decline any one favour asked of him by one of the guests, provided they brought a present for the bride. This fact is not a secret, but Flaherty doesn\u0027t share it willingly with anybody uninitiated. The players might learn of this from one of the other guests, including Jirvel. There is a bit more to his love for his sister then he would ever be willing to puplicly admit. He knows that this is wrong and it gnaws on his mind. He is hoping that once his sister is married he will be able to forget about these feeling, an empty hope."},{"name":"Jirvel","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dryad Minor Noble","description":" The Bride. Sister of Flaherty. While technically a noble of the Seelie Court, she is not yet seen as a proper member since she hasn\u0027t bounded yet. This fact means that she is still mortal, still ages, still bleeds, something she wants to change as soon as possible. She knew that her brother could never decide on a husband for her, so she decided to take things into her own hands. She has been using her influence over the forrests animals to search for a fitting husband. While she doesn\u0027t have a strong realm like her brother has the fact that she is not yet bonded means she is free to go whereever she pleases and as a result of that her net of favours, while not as strong actually extends even far outside the boundary of their native forrest. Her favorite tools are the birds, because they are the most free of creatures. This is how she learned about an ancient oak, many days travel outside her brothers sphere of influence. An oak so old that nobody she questioned could actually tell her how long it had been around. So she went to Freija, a young female human druid from the nearby village. And they went to seek out this oak and when they found it Freija awakened the old tree. After Freija cast her spell, the tree slowly started to stir and rise, look around, then take notice of the tiny creatures in front of him that had just given him sentience. When asked what his name was, he pondered for what Jirvel experienced to be an excrutiatingly annoying amount of time until finally telling them his name: Greagoir It took forever to get the slow giant back to the glade, especially since the daft fool would allways stop and look onto the most mundane things with amazement. When they finally arived at the glade she imediatly told her brother that she planned to marry the tree. He was at first against it, like she knew he would be, but she also knew that in the end he wouldn\u0027t deny her any request. Especially since he knows just how valuable a catch her husband was. And now only the wedding itself stands between her and finally bonding with her husband and becomming a fully fledged and very powerfull dryad. Secrets: Look at Freija\u0027s NPC block to find out the story of the two. Jirvel is actually very aware of the true nature of her brothers feeling for her. She doesn\u0027t feel the same in any way, she in fact despises him, for beeing so much older and more influential. In her mind, she should have been the one born first and the glade should have been hers. But she knows how to hide her feelings and knows how to use Flaherty\u0027s feeling to her advantage. Right now her brother is the most powerfull ally she has, but this might change soon. Her true ambitions are to be much more powerfull then her brother, to become to him as overpowering a presence as he had been to her all these years. She aims to shed the shackles of beeing only a \"minor\" noble, she would become a proper one, somebody that at the mere metion of her name would make all the other fey tremble both in awe and fear at the same time. Her brother might be content with beeing the Lord of the Glade, but she would be the Lady of the whole forrest. The Lady of the Woods, only that would be a proper titel for her. And this marriage is the next big step in achieving this goal."},{"name":"Freija","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Druid","description":" (I originally had this as part of Jirvel, but it really disrupted the flow of the narative, so I put it here because it is still important for the personality of Jirvel) If you asked Freija what the relationship between the two of them was, she would tell you that Jirvel was something like her fairy godmotherto her. If you asked Jirvel, she would tell you that she owns the girl. A few years back, when Freija was still a young girl learning the druidic ways from their village elder, she fell in love with a local boy called Myca. But Myca was older, his father was the local butcher, so he was quite well of. No way he would fall for the weird local tree girl. But then like in the fairy tails, a beautiful woman apeared to her in the woods and offered her. She knew so much, about how she was in love, how she could get closer to Myca, what to talk with him about to get him to like her. And with her help she managed to win the love of her live. She is now married to Myca, she is the local druid after the elder died and he is a hunter. They have a little daughter aged 3 and a little boy aged 1. She is very gratefull to her fairy godmother and would do anything for her. Jirvel first learned of the girl from one of her spies, the foolish child had actually been talking to the birds about her feelings. She had first gone to her village on a whim, feeling bored she had toyed with the idea of breaking the girls dreams, maybe take the boy away if he was really as handsome as the girl was saying. But when she laid eyes upon the girl she imediatley felt the potential she had to become a powerfull druid, and she had actually allready even found a mentor to guide her. So she made a plan, to take control over this girl, to aquire her while she was still young and dumb and easy to influence. First she charmed the boy, he wasn\u0027t really good looking, more like handsome but in a very common way. And once she had the boy devoted to her (an easy task, he was a teenage boy after all), she told him that if wanted to continue their relationship he would have to court this girl for her. She then went to the girl, told her what to do, what to say. In truth nothing the girl could have said, would have stopped the boy, she could have been a pig and he still would have done as Jirvel told him. And so the years passed and the girls power grew, when the girls mentor started to slow down her growth she got rid of him, and the girl grew to be much more powerfull then he had ever been. The boy grew too, when he was told to marry her he did so, when he was told to give her a child he did so, and every time he went out to hunt he would come to seek her out. She had no real desire to be with the boy, but she enjoyed the thought of his wife at home, with her children waiting for her beloved husband to return, while we lay with her amoung the leaves. The girls whole life, dancing as a pawn in the palm of her hand. And now that the girl had fullfilled her purpose she was still a powerfull pawn, but a disposable one. Jirvel very much looks forward to one day telling the girl everything and seeing her whole world crumble."},{"name":"Who are these crones, enchantresses, and fortune tellers?","genderRaceOccupation":"The witch smiles gleefully as she squishes the caterpillar between her fingers. \"Into the pot!\" she smiles as she tosses it into the bubbling, hissing liquid.\"","description":" Witches, seers, fortune tellers, and diviners are staples of fantasy worlds.

Othelius can passively anticipate many possible futures, and can give general predictions as to the way things will be in the next several weeks or months. He doesn\u0027t do long-term prophesying. Garian is a half-lich. He and his partner Othelius were the victims of an unfortunate experiment in ascending to lichdom via an artificial, true-neutral-aligned phylacterial ritual. Garian, too, is effectively immortal, but must remain in an unnaturally dry environment or his body will rapidly putrefy and decay. His prophecies are of the more traditional kind - from time to time, he\u0027ll be inspired to write poems or songs that cryptically foreshadow events several years or decades in the future."},{"name":"Roland Roggeveen","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Elf Farmer","description":" A tall golden-eyed elf with hair the color of grain. He often wears a tan tunic, and grey overalls. He has a small farm of his own, and lives there alone. In the small windmill on his farm he practices his magic, and makes many things for his plants, magical fertilizers to cause plants to grow in wonderful and strange ways, mulches that push out weeds, and protect the soil, and sprays to dissuade the presence of vermin, and insects in his crops. He will sell these to anyone who can show a good interest in plants."},{"name":"Clara Sheehy","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-Elf Phytomancer","description":" A soft spoken and kind woman. Her hair is bright white with tinges of red, and green. She mostly keeps to herself, preferring the company of the magical plants that she creates. Her home is a small cottage with sunflowers and rosebushes growing around its edges, and many raised gardens scattered around it. She can be quite shy around new people to the point of misdirecting them away from her cottage with elaborate illusions. When she is outside her house she usually wears a large straw sun hat with a white ribbon on its top."},{"name":"Hubert Donnelly","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Leprechaun Shopkeeper","description":" A brown eyed leprechaun who wears a green tunic, and brown overalls. He manages his own shop, and sells various magical trinkets as well as gardening supplies. A few of his own gardening tools are quite magical. He acts kind to those that enter his shop casually, but when someone that has a great need for something enters his shop he will do whatever he can to trade them what they want at the cost of something they have great sentimental value in. He can be very mischievous, and even taunting to those that have traded something to him that the once greatly adored, and will not easily trade it back to them."},{"name":"Gerhard Katirci","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Ogre Geomancer","description":" A large ogre with dark grey skin, and piercing green eyes and a set of spectacles. He speaks very intelligently, but has issues with using profanity often. He wears a dense, grey, woolen shirt, and tan overalls. He works in mines to prevent their collapse, and to locate the ore or gemstones in them. Often he uses his own strength to amend issues in the construction of a mine. He respects the earth and stone of the mines he works in, and can speak to it in a way to find the best way to reinforce it."},{"name":"Haukvir","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarven Watcher","description":" A quiet dwarf who lives in the ruins of a long-forgotten temple. His beard is glossy and black, as are his eyes. When he speaks, he speaks with many voices, in many accents, and none of them are Dwarvish."},{"name":"Bartholomew the Great and Powerful, First of His Name, Whose Arts Rattle the Vaults of Heaven","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-elf Charlatan","description":" Bartholomew (or, to his friends and/or paramours, Tol) is a lanky, somewhat frazzled half-elf with a shock of red hair. \u0027Shock\u0027 is an appropriate word; this stage magician uses what small sorcerous talents he has to swindle away the money of every backwoods family and small-town bumpkin from here to the Whitespire Mountains. Make no mistake, though: he might be terrible at performing magic, but he is a prodigy at summoning the eldritch horrors and assorted unsavory creatures that slaughter any who would turn him in to the authorities."},{"name":"Who are these demonologists, shadowhunters, crusaders, and exorcists?","genderRaceOccupation":"The old priest winks, drains his cup of wine, and spryly hops off his bar stool. \"Come on,\" he smiles, \"if we go now, I can get you in and out of the temple\u0027s crypt before the midnight devotions begin.\"","description":" Last week, we made some fiendish villains, so it seems fitting that we collect some NPCs who oppose such beings. These NPCs could run the gamut from eager allies to dangerous foils, but they should not be sinister on all accounts (to distinguish them from villains). The NPCs don\u0027t have to be developed deeply, but they should have enough suggested content that any DM could quickly fill in what\u0027s missing. I\u0027ll post a few examples."},{"name":"Brother Calymus","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Scholar","description":" A priest of the First Order of the Light, Brother Calymus is a spry, balding old man who\u0027s been wandering the world for half a century, seeking out ghosts, survivor\u0027s of near-death experiences, and other strange phenomenon attributed to the Spirit Realm. He\u0027s written two popular books on the topic and is happy to talk at length about the mysteries of death, especially over a cup of strong red wine. Whenever you run into Brother Calymus in a tavern or brothel, he\u0027s bound to know where some dark presence is lurking nearby in the world (and likely, he\u0027s eager to investigate once he finds the right help)."},{"name":"Sir Harrisen Figg","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Knight","description":" Tall and handsome with long dark hair and neatly-trimmed mustaches, Sir Harrisen was the heir of House Figg, but after the strange circumstances of the death of his sister, he renounced his inheritance and left his family to join the Watcher\u0027s Swords, pledging his life to hunting down enemies of the Moon Maiden\u0027s church. Figg has been particularly prolific in seeking out and destroying demons who reveal themselves in the world. He carries an ancestral sword that had been called Greatknife which he has renamed Fiendbane. When you meet him, you\u0027ll find he\u0027s a bit stiff, but he means well."},{"name":"Sister Dierdre","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Priestess","description":" Sister Dierdre\u0027s wide green eyes smile, despite a sadness lingering about her young face. She often fiddles with her long blonde braid when she speaks, especially if asked about her past. Dierdre was the promiscuous daughter of a high-ranking soldier, who couldn\u0027t seem to keep herself out of trouble, so her father sent her away to join the Second Order of the Light. She always approached ghosts and demons with fascination and, of late, has discovered her own talent as a medium between the world and the Spirit Realm."},{"name":"Lady Joenna Longfisk","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Knight","description":" Clad in mail and leather, Lady Joenna Longfisk is a tall maid with short-cropped auburn hair. She took up the sword against her father\u0027s wishes, following her young liege lord to battle in his fateful campaign against the Ice Clans. The campaign was largely successful, save the death of her liege lord. Too proud to return home, Lady Joenna pledged her sword in the service of the Storm King\u0027s Temple of Winter. Never at home among the men of the temple guard, a powerful priestess who had befriended her sent Lady Joenna back among the lands of the Ice Clans to search for an ancient shrine to the Storm King that\u0027s been lost for centuries."},{"name":"Goodson Harbert","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Exorcist","description":" With a missing eye and a wooden leg, Goodson Harbert cuts an intimidating figure, especially for a priest. He reeks of booze and speaks in a growl, but he\u0027s a warm soul beneath the gruff exterior. People say Harbert has been to the Hells and back, and no one who sees him would dare question that rumor. He\u0027s never risen high among the Goodsons of the Traveler, but he is respected by all within the church\u0027s hierarchy. If you have to face a demon, a ghost, or a questionably-sourced cask of ale, you\u0027ll want Harbert\u0027s hatchet and his box of potions and powders at your side."},{"name":"Bifgard Stonehouse","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Crusader","description":" His flame-orange beard a shaggy tangle, Bifgard Stonehouse is quick to draw his axe at the first whiff of goblins, ghosts, and wights. For years, he has been working in stages to clear the ancient dwarf-hold of Silverden of goblins and undead almost single-handedly. He comes down from the mountains twice a year to re-supply his camp and make half-hearted attempts at recruiting some help in his task. Bifgard speaks very little until he\u0027s had a few ales, and then he speaks too much–becoming angry with himself (and anyone around him) whenever he lets slip one of Silverden\u0027s secrets, setting himself to perform an awful penance to atone to the Great Smith."},{"name":"Quelma Starcircle","genderRaceOccupation":"Female High Elf Shadowhunter","description":" Quelma Starcircle remained in the World when the last of her people left centuries past, her task still unfinished. Her brilliant blue eyes are patient and her manner is as soft and straight as her flowing silver-blonde hair. With her sword and her bow, Quelma has dogged the arch-lich Arameedi from one end of the World to the other. She has slain it six times, and six times the lich has risen. Quelma will continue her dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with Arameedi until she finds the hiding place of its phylactery or until it destroys her."},{"name":"Goran the Grim","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Preacher","description":" A devotee of the Southron pantheon, Goran spends his days preaching the word of the God of Death in the market square (\"Prepare! Seek Death on your own terms, lest Trickery guide your path or Ruin take your strength!\"). Black-robed, gaunt, and pale with dark circles around his dark eyes, Goran\u0027s deep voice booms across the square beseeching all who will listen to make time for meditation on Death every day. Goran also sells a variety of amulets and potions that will ward off the curse of undeath, so that Death may be met peacefully and honorably."},{"name":"Al-bah Zorimun","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Paladin","description":" Al-bah Zorimun is a broad-shouldered knight who wears light copper scale armor and always carries a wicked scimitar on his left hip and several short spears slung across his back. Zorimun\u0027s head is shaved and his mustache is long and waxed, though he often keeps both hidden from the sun with a white cotton cowl has he wanders the desert on his trusted mare. Every sun up and sun down, Zorimun prays to the Sun God asking the First Light and the Last Light to touch his flashing blade that he might strike down the dark followers of the Dead God. Zorimun is quietly going about his bloody work, seeking out the tent-camps and caves where the followers of the Dead God hide."},{"name":"Inquisitor Marsolis","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Tiefling Priestess","description":" She tells her guests her name before they see her - Francesca. She lures them into confidence with a voice full of contrite abasement, sexual undertones, knowing humor. She laughs, she cries, she tells them she\u0027ll be flogged if she doesn\u0027t get the answers she needs. Whatever works. When she can, she walks behind them unseen, the soles of her boots whispering on the flagstones of her clean, spare chambers. Just as with any other tool, she uses violence sparingly and judicially... but first, if nothing else works, she steps from the shadows and pulls the hood from her head. When they see her crimson skin, they begin to scream; when they see the jet black ram\u0027s horns that curl from the back of her head and over her shoulders, they begin to confess."},{"name":"Sir Nicolas of Eastmark","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Sorcerer","description":" Sir Nicolas is a peculiar sort of knight; he doesn\u0027t joust, or compete at the sword, or do any number of things that your average everyday knight would do. Instead, he wears finely tailored clothes, tasteful yet expensive jewelry, and personally oversees all of the kingdom\u0027s dealings with adventurers and would-be heroes. Having retired from adventuring himself at the ripe old age of 45, his dark hair (with gray wingtips, lovingly maintained) and trained grey eyes are a fixture around the palace. He prefers to do things the easy way, rather than the way that involves copious amounts of explosions, but make no mistake: he isn\u0027t called the Mage Knight of Eastmark for no reason."},{"name":"Dame Elmeara Dragonback","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dwarf Paladin","description":" The first impression most people get of Elmeara is her armor: a set of brilliant white enameled plate, which under sunlight shimmers with a faint opalescence. Most trained warriors, sellswords, and hungry bandits scoff at such extravagance; after all, how experienced can one be without any battle damage on one\u0027s armor? Unfortunately for them, they are asking the wrong question. The right question: How good does Dame Elmeara have to be to come out of every fight with immaculate armor? The right answer: Very, very good."},{"name":"Alexei van Valerya, the White Hat","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Tiefling Assassin/Guard Captain","description":" Assassination is an art, and a difficult one at that. For every noble who travels in an open carriage through a city filled with tall buildings, there are five more who don\u0027t eat their breakfast until their entire court has a bite first. And yet, a select few kingslayers still manage to turn a profit. Alexei van Valerya knows the art of killing important people better than any other bodyguard, mostly because up until a few years ago, he was on the side of the artists. The ex-assassin-turned-security-chief cuts an unassuming figure; at 5\u002710 he\u0027s not the tallest, and at 160 pounds he\u0027s not the bulkiest. What he is, is effective. From his swept-back black horns to his toes, Alexei is all business. Tales around the palace say that he personally kills at least one foreign spy before breakfast, and two before lunch. He fights with his bare hands, or with garrote wire, or with long, ten-inch dirks that he wears on his back, and when he does, he is completely silent."},{"name":"Sygfellow Ottman","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Stonewarden","description":" Sygfellow comes from a long line of stonewardens whose job it is to walk the long paths between the eastern brunmallow and northern grasslands where brigands often lurk seeking easy prey, or roaming barbarians encroach. Because of the fact that he\u0027s constantly on the move going to town to hamlet, he has an intimate knowledge of the inhabitants of each and is often sought out for news and tales and, when the wine is particularly fine, a song. Syg is the fifth generation of his family yo take on the stonewarden mantle. Syg stands four feet, nine inches tall and has long brown hair and amber eyes. Syg is so used to traveling the long trade roads that he travels quite light and can live fairly easily off of what the land provides. He knows every nook on the forest\u0027s edge where he can find safe respite and where to find the best fish and game. He\u0027s seen these roads to often and knows the paths so well, that he can smell when something is amiss. You\u0027ll know him by his rough green cloak and his compact yew bow that carries with him, and if he asks you your business, you\u0027d do well to answer wisely. Sygfellow does not suffer fools kindly."},{"name":"Sir Aaron Irkell, the Beacon\u0027s Light","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Paladin/Cleric of Torm","description":" Sir Aaron stands at an average height of just 5\u00279\". His blonde hair is incredibly short, and he wears long purple robes under a breastplate emblazoned with the seal of Torm. You can find him, more often than not, tending to the wounded Lord\u0027s Alliance soldiers in the med tents of Qui. His words are brief and to the point, but he is kind and well-mannered. He heads a church of Torm in the city of Qui called \"The Beacon\" where he teaches mercy, healing and kindness. Those who meet Sir Aaron on the street or in his church will often find him lost in thought, dwelling on those he could not save and praying for those he is still trying to save."},{"name":"Brother Kiniffer","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Crusader","description":" A paladin of torm and war veteran, he wears a leather armored kilt and a light leather tunic at all times. He has seen more wars and single combat encounters in his life than most can honestly speak of, and its left him a bit crazed or blood lusted, its hard to tell. His eyes are wide, and his head\u0027s got patches of hair all about it in between the patches that have either fallen out or been ripped out. He is nearly maniacal in his desire to drive evil from the land and he\u0027s happy to engage in long conversations with those who would help him do it. You can find him training with the other brothers of the First Light Monastery, east of the High Forest."},{"name":"Talal","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Elf Mystic / con-artist (neutral selfish)","description":" Moral ambiguity personified with sandy blonde hair and a charming smile; a wink of his green eyes invites you into his secret. Most faiths have a secret cabal wherein special rites, prayers, and practices are rarely disclosed to the layman. However as a man of half truths and half lies, Talal can fit in to any one of these. Talal\u0027s specialty is knowing where these rituals take place and either owns or at least knows the location of cabalistic items of power.  "},{"name":"Keandra","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Tiefling Warlock / demon hunter","description":" Not everyone believes that hunting demons is a fulfilling career path. Thus was the belief of the arch devil Ezatan, who therefore sub-contracted his end of a deal to a young and desperate tiefling girl. Now that she is older, Keandra hunts demons with efficiency and indifference. Having no personal vendetta against the abyssal spawns, she finds no joy ridding the world of their evil. To her, it\u0027s just a job."},{"name":"Balchenod the White","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Tiefling Investigator","description":" The body was finally still beneath him, but he could feel the blood soaking into his pants. Still, he held the knife, hilt against the body\u0027s back, a few more seconds until he was sure it was only his own breath rasping in the dark cellar. \"Balch, you\u0027re getting sloppy,\" he muttered to himself as he willed his left hand to release the quarry\u0027s horn and slowly withdraw the ten inch dirk. The darkened skin of the tiefling on the floor seemed to go ashy in the inky black pool of its own blood. He\u0027d earned this bounty, but at what cost? Licking his lips unconsciously, he knew the self-flagellation tonight would be particularly intense."},{"name":"Krind Steeltoe","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Ranger","description":" A long braided brown beard and piercing blue eyes are the first thing you\u0027ll notice when see this dwarven ranger. He initially has a gruff demeanor, but becomes friendly enough once you known him for a while. A follower of Marthammor Duin, he aims to explore new lands and protect his fellow travelers and any people who he might meet on the road. Accustomed to hilly terrain and mountains, his recent travels though an unholy mountain pass have led him into combat with wicked undead far too often for his tastes, and he would welcome any help in exterminating this threat to the locals and travellers."},{"name":"Skrazano","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Kobold Soldier","description":" This loyal soldier is no ordinary kobold. Although he is at present nothing more than a soldier, he has been handpicked for the elite guard due to his skill and bravery in combat. Through his veins runs a sliver of metallic dragon blood, granting him power beyond that of an ordinary kobold. He is dedicated to his duty and speaks very little. And when he does speak, he speaks softly, barely more than a whisper."},{"name":"Aurak Gnar","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dragonborn Paladin","description":" Aurak Gnar is a 6\u00278\" golden metallic dragonborn. Wearing shining plate armor, wielding his silver sword and garrisoning his shield. Aurak is stern and outgoing, taking command where possible. He prefers to lead from the front and take a cautious approach to most things. Having survived numerous battles where patience, not the might of a sword arm, was the deciding factor. He is merciful to most beings, believing that everybody has the chance to turn to the light. However he acts without mercy or quarter to beings of evil and those who help them."},{"name":"Sivak Nala","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dragonborn Priestess of Bahamut","description":" Sivak Nala is a fierce silver dragonborn with a height around 6\u00273\". She wears simple armored robes and wields two short swords. Despite her cold outwards appearance, she is deeply caring for those in need and those who cannot defend themselves from the horrors of the dark. Her shy calm and graceful demeanor do not carry over to those of foul natures, even if they aren\u0027t innately evil beings. Driven and focused to the task at hand, Sivak Nala hunts down the dark forces of the world with equal measures of grace and cold malice."},{"name":"Bozak Rhogar","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dragonborn Knight","description":" Bozak Rhogar is large, even for a dragonborn. Standing at a towering 6\u002711\", and seemingly built out of a bronze wall, Bozak Rhogar is a force to be reckoned with. Known as a dispassionate fellow, Bozak holds no quarter to any who hold themselves outside of the law, or worse, the paths of darkness. Beneath his bronzed exterior lays a heart of, more bronze. Bozak is quiet and pensive, often going hours or even days without speaking. Preferring to instead answer with a nod, grunt, or silver maul."},{"name":"FlyHandle","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Aarakocra Mercenary","description":" A member of a radical mercenary guild, FlyHandle speaks very little, takes orders, and has little qualms as long as there is pay. He builds trust with long term contractors, and will slowly open up about his opinions and knowledge. He wears light armor, can class as a barbarian, and prefers spear-like weapons."},{"name":"Cadrielda Sabreen","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Shopkeeper","description":" The owner of Cadey\u0027s Trinkets, an arcane pawn shop carrying a variety of handy gadgets and minor magical items. Her long black curls come nearly to her waist. She wears large round spectacles and walks with a slight slouch, but she is otherwise modestly attractive. Cadrielda is shy and fidgety, and seems to consider interacting with customers to be a necessary evil. She can barely stay afloat because she is always tanking in stray animals. Unknown to most, she was once a druid, but was banished from her circle for dabbling in science, and many of the goods she sells are actually of her own invention."},{"name":"Kaivoth the Tall","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-orc Hunter","description":" A massive, late middle-aged half-orc with scarred gray skin. He lives as a hunter and adventurer, and is known to be a man of very few words.

One day she was given a job to assassinate a cleric of Bahamut. Not knowing this clerics strength, and falsely assuming in his age he was feeble and unable to defend himself she took a direct approach.

She\u0027s slowly expanding her circle of \u0027friends\u0027."},{"name":"Torbarth \"the Heavy Handed\"","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Paladin","description":" Among paladins, Torbarth has become a bit of a laughing stock. His approach to rooting out evil and corruption is ask those under scrutiny bluntly: \"do you serve the forces of order and goodness?\" In the case of a no, or an unconvincing response, Torbarth has been known to lurk just over the shoulder of the person in question, making note of their every decision. He has been known to keep this up for upwards of a fortnight before making his final judgement and moving on."},{"name":"Mill Burray","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Exorcist","description":" Genial and entirely average looking, Mill Burray makes a career of exorcising ghosts.

If asked, she politely diverts any questions about her uncannily unremarkable appearance by saying \"it\u0027s just a precaution, strictly necessary in this line of work.\" Often the only thing that Mekaela will ask in exchange for a bit of information on demons - or any demon in particular - is that her client keep her informed of any new relevant knowledge they gain.

His companion is a small, mute canary."},{"name":"Ronny Jainclout","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Weather-Enthusiast","description":" Born in a heavy rainstorm, Ronny has always loved the mightiest of Nature\u0027s squalls. Wears a tiny kettle on the top of his hat to collect rainwater - a drink he finds superior to all else.

Often employed by the self-righteous elitists who tell long-winded stories of how they gained their wealth. If objects were gained illegally, she...takes the burden off their weak shoulders. She steals from the rich and gives to herself. It\u0027s the thought that counts after all, right?

Find new stuff."},{"name":"Ogrim Battlestroke","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Mercenary","description":" Stereotypical warrior dwarf complete with expertly-forged armor and fearsome warhammer. Offers his services to all armies, with his preference being exotic and distant lands. Wakes up before sunrise on the day of battle, breaks out his canvas, and paints stunningly-detailed landscapes of the scene prior to being forever marred by blood and destruction. He sends these paintings back to his mother who thinks that he is merely a world-traveler who wishes to share his journeys with his only family."},{"name":"Golly the Gambibbler","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Linthijaz","description":" Golly galumphs presently board he once brillig, tromping on loofus made twisty by twill, to trill at a boohome for russets and dogherous burbles."},{"name":"Russel Folnhir","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dragonborn Chef","description":" Large among the largest of Dragonborn, mightier than warriors, quicker than thieves, and smarter than scholars, Russel\u0027s ambitions lie solidly in the kitchen. He\u0027s often questioned about his peculiar life, that of choosing to be a chef rather than act on what appear to be a divine set of natural talents and opportunities. Russel is better than most at what he tries, but does not care to do anything but cook. He makes a decent sum from his job at a small town\u0027s community mess hall, though a lot of his work is done for free out of the love of doing it. Has a halfling wife named Margaret, who works part time as a lumberjack."},{"name":"Sifvilgyplidiven the Unpronounceable","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human-ish Wizard","description":" Sifvilgyplidiven doesn\u0027t remember much of his parents, Tyghroiulmborttsmn and Yyyalianmmhjahtyrhba, but knows that his name has some greater meaning. He lives a simple life in an underground home beneath his pet project, a self-sufficient haberdashery catering mainly to the sale of hats. Despite being a wizard he is unable to do much beyond basic tricks, but knows more about obscure rituals and spells than anyone. He will teach travelers these things, but only if they can pronounce his name. Those who succeed also get a discount on hats."},{"name":"John Smith","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Commoner","description":" John constantly feels like the background character of a good book. His best friends Rydgar and Thorgrin the God Slayer seem exciting, living adventurous lives. In comparison, he\u0027s content with the simple 9-5 bustle of his medium sized town, his average home, and his hobbies. He collects coins of historical value, and has a large collection that he\u0027s quite proud of. John is so normal that he almost feels out of place. But then, how normal can he be? If normal is a barbarian devil killer, then isn\u0027t John abnormal? But that doesn\u0027t seem right. He is normal, it\u0027s the world that\u0027s strange! John wrestles with these thoughts often."},{"name":"Mepis Soutan","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-Elf Journalist","description":" Journalism isn\u0027t exactly the most respected career paths in the world, but it\u0027s exciting. Mepis got her start writing for The Copper Pape writing about the unimportant nonsense of small town life such as which blacksmith was hammering who\u0027s codpieces. She caught a big break after securing an exclusive interview with Pelor, somewhat breaching her ethics policies by bribing him with the famous muffins of a local chef Russel Folnhir. She\u0027s now a columnist for The Astral Quill, and has been trying to secure an interview with someone that will take her career to the next level."},{"name":"Eubor Westmin","genderRaceOccupation":"Undead Arms Dealer","description":" Eubor was once a person of some description, turned undead by some necromancer of some other description. He doesn\u0027t care for the particulars. Upon being raised, Eubor found that being an undead minion wasn\u0027t for him so he left to pursue other options. He now makes a living by taking weapons from dungeons, battlefields, etc and selling them. It\u0027s not a noble living, nor a living at all for Eubor, but it occupies eternity."},{"name":"Yulmon Taed","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Author","description":" Yulmon occupies his time writing short stories, as well as occasional re-imaginings of folklore. His first book, The Boy and the Sweet +4 Shortsword was a big hit, giving him the fanbase to leave his miserable job as a haberdasher and write full time. He mainly sells his stories to The Astral Quill. Right now he\u0027s working on his first novel, A Game of Fancy Chairs."},{"name":"Hirai Doyle","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Child Detective?","description":" Hirai is a child who calls himself a detective, and seems to possess intelligence and skills unlike any child should have. He also looks remarkably similar to a teenage detective from the area who went missing the same day the boy appeared, though with some glasses. This is of course just a coincidence, obviously. He frequently gets into dangerous situations, left to save the day using various gadgets created for him by his elderly gnome friend, Instructor Christie Herschel."},{"name":"Daven Frealor","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Actor","description":" Daven is an actor, that much is simple. His real last name is Radtaie, but he changed it as there was already an actor named Daven Radtaie and there are rules to this business. He\u0027s considered semi-famous, holding a lot of minor roles in the big plays and some major roles in the smaller ones. His upcoming gig, standing in for a larger actor who quit acting to pursue a career in haberdashing, could be what he needs to break into the big leagues. His acting\u0027s fine, but he\u0027s just a bit too dramatic at times. If you want more detail, Mepis Soutan once reviewed his performance in Undeath of a Salesman."},{"name":"Dot","genderRaceOccupation":"Male and Female Human Twins","description":" Pip and Dot are male and female, respectfully, and are identical twins. As kids it was cute, but as they grew older their interests diverged and now they just get on each other\u0027s nerves. Pip is an enchanter, and Dot is a ranger. Both are highly respected by those around them, and both are proper and well mannered. Put them together and they argue like children. Without having talked to each other in years, they each met and married one of a set of twins, Tim and Tammy, with similar circumstances and none of the four knowing anything about the situation. Coincidentally, Pip and Dot\u0027s older brother Jon is good friends with Tim and Tammy\u0027s older sister Jane, having met outside the situation. That first family reunion was a confusing one."},{"name":"Bryce Bladewalker","genderRaceOccupation":"Male. Human druid. Serial Killer.","description":" Favourite saying: The only thing I\u0027ll trust a woman to do is stay dead. Personality: A real go-getter, he can\u0027t stand laziness. Alcoholic. Widowed. Important memories: His wife, leaving him for a wizard whose every need was attended by magical servants. Strangling that wizard with his bear hands. An alcohol-fuelled haze of pain and regret."},{"name":"Laura Midsommer","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Basket-weaver","description":" She sits outside on clear days, weaving. With subtle yet somehow striking auburn hair, and a face rounded but fine. \"The Jewel of the town\" she was described. She is however as cold to others as the north wind."},{"name":"Stonebeard","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Mason","description":" \"Stonebeard\" not going by his birth name due to a contempt for his father who is considered \"A lousy drunkard\" even among dwarfs. Due to this he has a unusual fondness of \"family values\" and has a strong moral code. He travels around the human cities offering his extensive knowledge on stonework."},{"name":"Antonio Pyre","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Acolyte","description":" Acolytes are often seen as unsociable to regular folk. Antonio is a man of common tastes, which has left him unable to gain higher status in his church. He would spend his evenings drinking and whoring. His sins should not be taken for complacency in religion, in his sinful conquests he would take the lowest of the low into the arms of god."},{"name":"Evylin Silverwind","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Elf(?) Adviser-to-the-king","description":" A beautiful elf with silver hair flowing to her ankles. She is rarely seen far from the king, the few that have spoken too her see her as unusual. She is mostly unversed in human culture, unusual for anyone living in the heart of a human city."},{"name":"Stron Leather-Arm","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Butcher","description":" Stron is a brazen fellow, harsh of word and sharp of tongue. Many distrust him as a half-orc, his profession does not help public opinion. While many butchers do not care much for the final product, Stron is a true gourmet, not cut of meat is too fine for his taste. He shares this only with his more friendly customers."},{"name":"Sapphire","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Prostitute/Spy","description":" Many prostitutes in the slums are driven to it by lack of options. Sapphire however has carved her own path from day one, she was a sharp young lady, too good for a brothel, but she was happy with it. After a few years, she knew how eager men (and some women) were to spill their guts. The lesson Sapphire learned was playing with politics was much more profitable."},{"name":"Marrak Sunstone","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Arena-Fighter","description":" A man skilled in the martial arts is not uncommon, but one that can work a crowd so well is. A strong distinguished jawline and an even stronger voice. He is known for fighting with a falchion and sling, rather than the more common sword and shield."},{"name":"Biri Bluebarrel","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Halfling Brewer","description":" From a long line of famous brewers, Biri is no less skilled. The fine blue-tinted ale her family is named for however is like poison to her tongue. Biri is cursed to never enjoy her gifts. She is loved by many, and despite not drinking makes any party lively."},{"name":"Thalar Yet","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dragonborn Wandering Teacher","description":" Thalar always found an odd love of humans, interested in their quarrels and struggles. She alone has become almost a legend travelling from village to village, every one left better off for it. She was taught well while young possessing great knowledge in healing, agriculture and combat. Thalar\u0027s love of humans even lead to her discarding the name of her clan for a name that humans found easier to say."},{"name":"Skarrak Sunlight","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Tiefling Priest","description":" Masochist, is the one word that comes to mind when people speak of Skarrak. He is hated for his appearance, yet he retains a paragon of honor, virtue and piety. Through great pain he has removed his horns, over years cut away his tail. A man wounded in mind, some pity him above all others. (Phew 10, I should probably stop now)"},{"name":"Sarim Marshwalker","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Ranger","description":" Lives on the edge of the swamplands, and will act as a guide for any who can pay a fair tariff. Though outwardly gruff, he can be fairly pleasant. That is, unless you ask about his scars... The last group to pass that way still haven\u0027t been found."},{"name":"Ravn Erickson","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Bard","description":" Old man Ravn has a tale for every night of the year, and knows more songs than there are stars in the sky. He wonders the northlands in search of heroes and adventurers to question, and will happily allow a road-weary party to share his fire in exchange for their story. His sage advice has more than once saved kingdoms from collapse, and is a welcome guest at any lord\u0027s dwelling."},{"name":"Winna","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Barmaid","description":" Though she seems dim at first, young Winna is as sharp as a razor. She knows all the comings and goings in town, and rumour has it she knows the leaders of the Thieves Guild. Woe betide any who would raise a hand to her."},{"name":"Valdi Galanodel","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Elf Ranger","description":" A strong but paranoid leader, Valdi is fiercely protective of both her land and her kin. She views outsiders with vehement disdain, and rarely allows trespassers on her land to pass unchallenged. Her pride has led to friction with the nearby human and dwarf settlements, and both are becoming increasingly concerned by her readiness to slay any who put so much as a toe across her borders."},{"name":"Lord Kristian Fiermann","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Lord","description":" As corrupt as they come, Lord Fiermann sees himself a strong and capable man, though in fact his strength comes from his wife and her family, whose ambition far outstrips his. He frequently raises taxes to support his wife\u0027s \"projects\", and turns a blind eye to the numerous missing villagers who seem to wind up in his dungeons. He won\u0027t have anything to do with dark magic, though it is clear his wife is secretly attempting to summon demons to further her own goals."},{"name":"Jackson Stern","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Miscreant","description":" Everyone in town knows Jackson, forever in trouble with the Town Guard. He\u0027s a troubled boy, and his petty crimes are going to see him hung. He strives to be the best thief this side of the Eastern Sea, but is so clumsy he mostly ends up causing minor damage to properties instead, before failing to steal anything before the Town Guard turns up to drag him back to the cell in the barracks. They joke he should be paying them rent."},{"name":"Father Osmund","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Cleric (War Domain)","description":" Old Father Osmund is a devout racist. Though he outwardly strives to \"better the world\", he is zealous to the point of fanaticism. He can be found wherever there is a human lord looking to stamp out a local non-human community, or otherwise spends his time persecuting non-human members of society. He seeds rumours, sometimes even planting incriminating evidence in dwellings, before offering to be the one to deal with them once the mob is roused."},{"name":"Tess D\u0027Orvic","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Sorcerer","description":" Tess is the epitome of bad luck. Though she is one of the strongest sorcerers in the land, her art rarely manifests itself in the way she intends. She\u0027s on the run now, after that time she agreed to help deal with a ghost in the town cemetery, only to accidentally disturb all the other resting souls into haunting the town. When she reported to the council, so deep was her anxiety that her wild magic flared once again, and now none of them can talk, except to make farm animal noises. The price on her head is quite large these days."},{"name":"Asher","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Rogue","description":" No job is too grim for Asher - for the right price he\u0027ll do almost anything. And he is good at what he does. Once the fee is paid, you won\u0027t see him again until the job is done. Don\u0027t expect him to stay quiet about it though. A few ales and he\u0027ll tell anyone anything."},{"name":"Kydd","genderRaceOccupation":"Female(?) Human(?) Child(?)","description":" No-one knows anything about Kydd\u0027s origins. She is only ever seen before a town suffers a cataclysmic event, and stories of her appearances go back centuries. There have only been two occasions where she has spoken, and the persons to which she spoke became heroes of legend. No town has ever survived longer than 24 hours after she appears there. Perhaps she is the cause, or merely a warning?"},{"name":"Estragon Morrins","genderRaceOccupation":"Mysterious Gnome Merchant","description":" A middle-aged man who feigns madness and sells an incredibly powerful poison known to cause septicemia which is in fact ditchwater."},{"name":"Old Greg","genderRaceOccupation":"Generic Old Guy","description":" Greg is a generic old guy who sits in the corner of the tavern and occasionally shouts \u0027Lord Sprinkleton? Ah, not many people know the story of Lord Sprinkleton these days\u0027. Unfortunately, he doesn\u0027t know all that much. He will only ever recount his childhood on the farm and explain vaguely relevant elven and dwarfish conspiracies because he is violently racist."},{"name":"Rod Osmington","genderRaceOccupation":"Angry Merchant","description":" Rod has just escaped a troubled relationship with his father, in which his father decided to give him his full inheritance in chickens and land. Rod is now seeking people who will trade chickens for chicken food or actual money, and is therefore first seen leading thirty chickens or so. He does not like talking about it and will be gruff to any that ask why he has so many chickens."},{"name":"John the cat","genderRaceOccupation":"A Cat","description":" John is a cat, who will follow the party around. Flip a coin: Heads, he\u0027s the familiar of a suitably powerful wizard. Tails, he\u0027s literally just a cat. He is exceptionally stupid, and will often run off to stupid places. If the party decides to follow him around, he will consistently get them into trouble by biting important people, running away to secret bandit hideouts, and attacking the wizard\u0027s spellbook."},{"name":"Triggart Darkfeather","genderRaceOccupation":"Tengu, Merchant","description":" I dont have time to do the Ten but Ill toss a few in here. Two of whom I played before starting DMing, Ive found them useful as NPCs because I like them. Small and pale and a great desire to be evil. Sometimes sides with good for his own later benefit. Wanted nothing more than to become a Lich god. Hated good Necromancers more than anything in the world. Hated his father for cruel magical experiments. VERY strong hatred of anything evil. Able to detect alignments, worshiped a troll god. Used a sword that was too big for him and was way smarter than him. After his people were killed he was raised from infancy by a gang of human thieves. Believed himself for a long time to be human, thinks everyone sees him as human. He often thinks he needs to explain to people that he isnt human. Because he was raised by humans he behaves like a human and not an elf. Mildly racist against any other race. See\u0027s Tengu as inherintly superior. Loves shiny things. Makes no bones about using other races for his own benefit. This is all I have time for. Id love to do more but maybe Ill comment again later if I can."},{"name":"Thurnaz \"Stormchaser\" Gathakanathi","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Goliath Cleric (Tempest Domain)","description":" He always felt an affinity for foul weather, so one day he left his family and followed the storms around the mountains. One day, he came across a shrine below a statue of a storm god, with a chest. The chest contained armour, robes and weapons, all marked with the sign of the storm (lightning bolts, wind and clouds). He believes that the storm spirits chose him for great things."},{"name":"Keranth Arbright","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Wizard","description":" Keranth is about 68 years old, has a heavily lined face and long white hair and a short beard. He tells people this: He has spent the majority of his life on purely theoretical studies of the arcane, and has recently sold his house to go travelling. The truth is this: He is a necromancer, whose spellbook is his own flesh. Spells are tattooed onto his body using the blood of innocents as ink. The main hint of this is that he does not have a spellbook. He is a generally kindly fellow with a cheerful attitude to life, whenever in company."},{"name":"Jeorg Spravahich","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Orc Weaponsmith","description":" Some people, upon entering the weaponsmiths trade, settle for reliability and a steady income by manufacturing swords, axes, shields, the usual. Not Jeorg. Jeorg specialises in experimental seige weaponry, with emphasis on \"mental\". Ballistae which fire smaller ballistae, giant crossbows which fire metal shrapnel in almost every direction, trebuchets with a range of several kilometers but fall apart every time you fire them, he makes them all. And as he watches the test-shots, he laughs a deep hearty laugh that hints at the insanity within. (Based on this guy.)"},{"name":"Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome Barbarian","description":" It is not exactly certain that his name really is \"Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach\", everyone simply assumes that it is because that is what he introduces himself as. His speech is distorted, however, by the ritual piercings of a member of his tribe who is on a Blood Quest. This piercing takes the form of a relatively large iron bar passing through both cheeks, impaling the tounge in passing, with symbols of his god on the end of each bar, holding it in place. He also abhors writing, making communication all but impossible. He has settled in the countryside far from his homeland, as some unknown incident has erased his memory of the details of Blood Quest, he only remembers that he is on one, and that the bar may not be removed before it is complete. His speech is incomprehensible. For example, \"Can you direct me to the nearest tavern?\" becomes \"Chlaag urghh urechh ee oo aa eggaech aggerrr?\""},{"name":"Kimberly Parish","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Vampire Innkeeper","description":" Kimberly tends a bar in a dive town, and yet somehow the bar patrons are unusually quiet and docile once through the doors. Unlike any other inn in town, disputes are settled calmly, fights are unheard of, and lewd behaviour is nonexistent. This may have something to do with the covered bite marks on the patrons shoulders, and what may be hidden behind the scarf Kimberly keeps wrapped around her neck."},{"name":"Vonrick the Valient","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Paladin/Knight","description":" Vonrick is the quinessential knight; he is tall, strongly-built and honourable as well as charming. He only hopes that none find out his gifts with the sword and lance came as a deal with a demon. The price was the life of his own brother, who Vonrick led to the lake and drowned as a young teen."},{"name":"Old Obert","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Wizard","description":" While Obert is pushing 100 years of age, he will vehemently argue any claims that his abilities are dwindling. He spends most of his time alone in his tower outside of the village, trying to perfect a spell he had dreamed of years ago."},{"name":"Peter of the Old Order","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Cleric","description":" Under his cream-coloured cloak and old roughspun tunic and with his gentle way of speaking, one may confuse Peter as a man against violence. However, he is a recruiter for one of the strongest military-churches in the land and had no qualms against wielding his hammer against those he sees as sinners."},{"name":"Sir Michael Mill","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Sword-fighting instructor","description":" Michael showed great promise with the sword in his youth, and was even knighted for his efforts in battle. However, at the age of 21, he stepped in a bear trap. The foot became infected and it was amputed. He now trains the younger boys in his town on swordplay."},{"name":"\"Lute\"","genderRaceOccupation":"Male halfling Bard","description":" A travelling singer and lute-player, simply known as \"Lute\". He chooses to follow adventuring parties for inspiration for new songs."},{"name":"Ella \"Nightstinger\"","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-elf Archer/Hunter","description":" Growing up as a Half-Elf in a Human village can be difficult enough, especially when one wants to become the first female hunter. However, her ability to hunt at night has earned her the respect of the others."},{"name":"Keltrin","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Warlock","description":" Cloaked in blacks and reds, Keltrin always seeks out new cities to perform her dark magic. For a price, one can borrow her skills, but there is no knowing when your payment will be finished."},{"name":"Quiet Ben","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Bodyguard","description":" Three things make Ben the outstanding bodyguard that he is: his bear-like stature, his loyalty to his employer and the day his father cut his tongue out for humiliating him in front of a Prince."},{"name":"Maggie Bluestream","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-Elf birdkeeper","description":" Maggie is a Half-Elf. She understands that there are those in this world who do not take kindly to species-mixing. Her brother had warned her as much before he was captured in a raid when they were young. She has cut off the points to her ears, takes in the sun as much as she can, and plays the fool when she hears Elvish being spoken. She dresses herself in Human clothing, and has stopped practising any customs from her childhood. She has been put in charge of the messenger-pigeons for the Baron, and prays that one day she finds Elves contacting him, so she may try to find a home with people more accepting."},{"name":"Khyban","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dragonborn General","description":" Khyban was never meant to become a General. She had six brothers, all of them strong and capable of command. It was Khyban\u0027s lot to work with potions, or inter-clan diplomacy, or to help raise the younglings of her brothers. Dragonborn clans don\u0027t often look kindly on those who reject the role given to them. But when a Dragonborn returns home one night displaying the severed head of a Hill Giant, before they have even fully reached adulthood, it is impossible to ignore them. Khyban knows how to reward captains and soldiers who please her in battle. Displeasing Khyban rarely happens now."},{"name":"Sir Annory Garfield","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Captain","description":" Though his family name does carry importance in the kingdom, there isn\u0027t a knight who thinks Annory has earned the respect himself. Sir Annory has notoriously been part of battles that were already largely won, or were an easy victory. He has always requested to be stationed near less-troublesome areas. However, none of this works to lessen his arrogance, and he will inflate his achievements in battle whenever his honour is questioned."},{"name":"Darber Claytop","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Diplomat","description":" Darber is perhaps the only famous Dwarf in the kingdom who didn\u0027t earn such fame with a weapon. His crowning achievement thus far has been his negotiations with Karg the Big. Karg was an Orc chieftan who had grown his war pack large enough to threaten the city. However, using his snakelike tongue, Darber was able to stave off the Orc invasion for four full days; enough time for reinforcement cavalry to arrive and smash the Orc host. Darber now works within the city as a highly-respected ambassador."},{"name":"Captain Bobbla of the Cerulean Shadow","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Halfling Pirate","description":" When she is in the company of other pirate captains, Bobbla will brag that her ship hasn\u0027t needed to seek a shore in over eight years. Her success with ship-raiding has been such that the sea provides all the treasure she needs. She leads her crew of Halflings in the long, blue-painted ship known as the Cerulean Shadow. If Bobbla wishes to remain unseen in a shadow, she will do so. If she desires that her ship remain unseen in broad daylight, it too will do so. No non-Halfling have ever survived once they step on Bobbla\u0027s ship, so the secret to the boat\u0027s stealth remains a mystery."},{"name":"Gretchen Farseer","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Soothsayer","description":" Gretchen was once a talented seer for her marshland clan. She had correctly predicted bandit raids, locust swarms, plague, lightning storms and even wars. Her predictions have saved her clan innumerable times, and for this she has been treated with great reverence within her clan. It is a shame that her talents have dwindled with her advanced age, however. It has been four years since she has claimed to see anything but the supposedly incoming \"ocean of fire\"."},{"name":"Elena Redlegs","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Goblin Queen","description":" Goblins attacker her village. Her daughter was killed in the raid by a Goblin chieftan. She begged her king for help, but none was provided. So she took her kitchen knife, sneaked into the Goblin cave, somehow found the sleeping chieftan and took his head. She was found soaked in his blood, and carrying his head. For this, the Goblins kneeled to her and proclaimed her the new chieftan. For the past two years, Elena has led raids with her ever-growing Goblin clan on her former king\u0027s outposts for revenge of his inaction."},{"name":"Handsome Andre","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human creeper","description":" I can offer some that were discontinued from previous campaigns that I liked: An expert marksman who could thread a needle with an arrow at 100 yards despite only being 13 years old. Will no doubt be a legend in years to come. Very shy and has unfortunate bumfluff. Physically quite weak, and cannot finish a sentence without his voice cracking. Once was nearly killed by an Owlbear. Well known in his small town for bringing home large game from hunts with expert killing blows. Andre is a 1/10 ugly creepy dude with a smoking hot 10/10 wife. He was given the ironic nickname \"Handsome\" after he married his extremely attractive and loyal wife who is beloved by the town. Unknown to the townsfolk Andre made a pact to sell his soul to a demon when he was young in order to make his high school crush fall in love with him forever. (In my game he was a warlock but he doesn\u0027t have to be) He was an adventurer for several years, and uses the money he earned to make a living as a patron of local sculptors, masons and painters, paying their living expenses for an extortionate proportion of the profits from their work."},{"name":"Thaemos Leafstrider","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Wood Elf Priest","description":" A handsome elf with golden hair and an uneasy smile. He is sympathetic to those who suffer, but he is very cautious to meddle in others affairs: \"That is nature\u0027s way.\" He is (or was) the caretaker of a sacred place, deep in an ancient forest. He is loathe to share the secrets of that place."},{"name":"Mairiel Moonblossom","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Wood Elf Druid","description":" Long, silky amber hair frames the elf-maiden\u0027s sharp features and deep blue eyes. She lives lonely, even by wood elf standards. She spends most of her days meditating in a remote sacred grove in an ancient forest that is filled with terrors. She knows many secrets of the forest, but the promise of uncovering its deeper secrets can draw her away from her sacred grove."},{"name":"Eloranae Mistdancer","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Wood Elf Ranger","description":" The elf wears a dull cloak clasped beneath her chin with a brooch of swirling crystal; her iridescent green eyes gaze wistfully as her platinum hair flutters gently in the wind. Eloranae has been walking to the ends of the world, looking for what few wood elves remain. She is the last of her house and carries an immense sorrow behind her eyes. She is a true friend, but unleash\u0027s an incredible fury upon her enemies, sometimes waiting decades or centuries before the opportune moment to take revenge."},{"name":"Corian Leafstrider","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Wood Elf Scout","description":" The blonde elf tosses his hair over his shoulder and stifles his laugh long enough to take a swallow of wine from the skin that hangs about his neck. When set on a task, Corian will carry it out with unerring determination; his family sometimes jokingly chide him as \"Half-Elven,\" suggesting he may carry the blood of men within him. When not on a specific mission, Corian is a merry companion; keeping company mostly with men and halflings in the travelers\u0027 camps in the forest or at the travelers\u0027 along the road. His family, especially his brother, thinks Corian is a troublemaker; the truth is Corian feels the sadness and loss that others do, perhaps more sharply, and he drinks and makes-merry so as not to be consumed by the gloom."},{"name":"Cirthoeil II of House Darkwater","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Wood Elf King","description":" A muscular elf with golden brown hair and a grim countenance. Cirthoeil has reigned as the King of the Shadowwood for centuries, though few outside his woodland realm have ever heard of him; he is a just ruler among his people, but he is not kind to outsiders. In his youth, he traveled widely and fought bravely against many earthly and otherworldly evils. Possessing no magical gifts of his own, he is especially jealous and suspicious of spellcasters or those who carry items of great magical power with them."},{"name":"Winnie \"The Pixie\" Shoemaker","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Harlot","description":" This petite, sleepy-eyed brunette was beautiful once, and she can still enchant: It\u0027s in the way she moves. Winnie has had a hard go of it, she rarely laughs anymore, and no one seems to know where she grew up. She\u0027s been a staple of the taverns and brothels of the River District for years, and she\u0027s notched some impressive tricks into her belt: Fearsome outlaws, well-known ship captains, wealthy merchants, and \"the world\u0027s greatest thief.\" She used to be the life of the party, but the joy of ale and wine have begun to wane, as does her beauty."},{"name":"Aldorn Braxton","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Thief","description":" A dark-eyed man with a winning grin scans the room with his keen eyes. Aldorn is a treasure-hunter, a thrill-seeker, an excellent friend to those who will lead him to opportunities for gold and glory. He claims to be the \"world\u0027s greatest thief,\" and he\u0027s well-known in the low districts and in high society alike, though he\u0027s not always welcome in either. Aldorn is quick to draw on his wits and his knife for any who doubt his claims, but he knows when to run: \"The better part of greatness is staying alive.\""},{"name":"\"Hobo\" Tim","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Drunk","description":" A portly man with several tattoos mumbles incoherently from under his long, unkempt grey beard. The people of the River District call him \"Tim,\" and he answers, but no one really knows his name (of course, they call him \"Hobo,\" and he answers to that too. He is usually harmless, mumbling about needing coin at passers by; erratically, he will last out with racist tirades, particularly directing them at dwarves. He has been stumbling around the River District for at least fifteen years; although it\u0027s not clear if he even knows who or what he was before then, he does sport an unusual tattoo of a man-spearing-a-shark-eating-a-dragon-eating-a-dwarf."},{"name":"Sir Ayrin Favager","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Knight","description":" Sir Ayrin clanks about in his steel armor, carrying a warhammer, a shield, and a holier-than-thou attitude. He grew up as a commoner, a blacksmith\u0027s apprentice, but he was raised up to knighthood after he saved a powerful lord\u0027s son in a skirmish with a rival at a tavern. Sir Ayrin had been proud of his work at the forge; now he\u0027s even prouder of his elevated social rank. He tends to be suspicious that people are cheating him; after being offered the position of knight, he first refused believing the lord\u0027s messenger was mocking him."},{"name":"Ole Moonsen","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Sailor","description":" Atop Ole\u0027s big frame sits a red-round head with dark, short-cropped hair, dark stubble of a beard, and watery blue eyes. He has sailed on trading vessels up and down the coast for several years. Ole tends to be forgetful about details, but he\u0027s reliable enough when it comes to the tasks aboard a ship. He loves to share bawdy stories and jokes over some wine or ale, and once he starts drinking, he rarely stops until he\u0027s snoring."},{"name":"Baris Tyrento","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Sheepherder","description":" Unshaven and unwashed, Baris stinks of sheep and looks even worse, clad in filthy leathers and a ragged cloak. He owns a few dozen sheep and scrapes a living off sale of wool (and occasionally mutton) that he trades with the merchant caravans that venture far enough north to pass his homestead. Ever since he caught a caravan guard flirting with her, Baris fears that his pretty young wife will leave him for someone more handsome and dashing. Baris was twice before, but each of his previous wives left him childless when she died."},{"name":"Iliana \"Illy\" Portnoir","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Assassin","description":" Illy is a beautiful dark-haired woman with a small but athletic frame and lips that were made for kissing. She lies about everything: \"Don\u0027t trust me,\" she coos with a wink. She hires her services (many as they are) out for a steep price, but she always delivers: \"No one does it better than me,\" she says with a sweet smile. Most kills are strictly business, but some kills she enjoys, as she seeks the men who killed her father when she was a girl."},{"name":"Gerwac, the Knowing","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Wizard-Headmaster","description":" Few have seen the face of the headmaster of the Steelmoon Academy, but those who have describe him as a thin man with an unsettling gaze. He spends much of his time in the seclusion of his study; on occasion, he visits the school\u0027s library or walks the grounds, wearing a heavy black cloak with a hood drawn about his face. Nothing is known of Gerwac before he founded the school a few decades ago, choosing what is believed to be a haunted mountain for its grounds. His school is as secretive as he is; little is known about the school to those outside it, and it is whispered that the students fear him tremendously."},{"name":"Daek Obskur","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Curio-Shopkeeper","description":" The spry old man has silver gray hair and whiskers and ruddy skin stretched across his long hooked nose and the rest of his bony face; he eyes his customers keenly. \"Welcome, welcome! May I collect the dust from your feet? Travelers\u0027 feet are full of interesting sands and lints from far off places—quite useful for magic.\" The old man doesn\u0027t wait for an answer but drops his book and scrambles over the counter to begin collecting dirt from his customers\u0027 feet, collecting it into small glass vials. He is cautious about local laws, but he knows a good customer when he sees one; he raises his voice speaking loud enough that anyone out on the street could hear him, \"Though I don\u0027t know how to do any magic myself.\""},{"name":"Torrek Holdeger","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Armorer","description":" The dwarf pensively strokes the long dark brown braid of his beard; his other hand rests atop the hammer strapped to his belt. Torrek is a perfectionist; trained by a master craftsman, his own skill exceeds that of his former mentor.

Jurk will fiercely defend the honor of his fallen king at the least provocation."},{"name":"Cirolas Summerstar","genderRaceOccupation":"Male High Elf Storyteller","description":" The lanky, brown-haired elf looks about with his wide green eyes, taking in everything. He knows the histories and songs of many peoples and places, their legends and their endings, and can tell their stories so they are all-at-once epic, personal, comedic, and tragic. He knows how to tell a story, but he also knows how to listen for one: \"And then?\" nodding eagerly. He belongs to an ancient and noble house and is seeking some secret piece of lore."},{"name":"Jelenneth Wintermoon","genderRaceOccupation":"Female High Elf Oracle","description":" The sight of the thin blonde elf with brilliant blue eyes and a faraway gaze fills you with a pang of loss. She has watched the stars for centuries; she knows the doom they foretell and it fills her with sadness. Jelenneth longs to uncover new portents and omens that contradict what she has foreseen.

He ascended to chief of the Palefist clan at a relatively young age by stabbing the previous chief through the back with his blade, cutting his heart out, and devouring it; ever since, he\u0027s been uniting the Eastern clans through a combination of intimidation, bribery, slaughter, and lies. Thrakk has aspirations to drive the Eastern Horde over the mountains to invade the Western Kingdoms; if he can and if he adds the Northern clans to his horde, he may well conquer the world. If you meet Thrakk, chances are you are already dead and on his dinner plate; if you\u0027re alive, he must see some use for you, and he\u0027ll most likely kill you when that use has expired."},{"name":"Kuranath","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Pit-Fighter","description":" Scars cover much of his nearly hairless head and neck, and he often cradles an oddly shaped brass knuckle in his hand. He enjoys being around people, but he is often silent among them.

Lurg is big and stupid, but he can follow simple instructions well enough. He will readily follow anyone who promises him the opportunity to smash things, taking greater satisfaction from this than from anything gold can buy. Lurg is easily distracted by food, and he is particularly fond of wines and pungent cheeses."},{"name":"Gaeryon Vyn Dordevetym","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Merchant","description":" The cloth merchant laughs nervously as he wipes the sweat from his brow with a lace-trimmed silk handkerchief.

He travels the roads in a yearly cycle with a small cadre of guards and a man-servant, purchasing raw wool from rural sheepherders and bringing them cloth and a handful of other dry goods produced in the city.

Moved by compassion, she managed to help one girl escape, but the other was run down by her former comrades in the attempt. Having been seen in the attempt, she had no choice but to run or to face death, as would have been the punishment meted out by the spider priestess. She and her young companion have been wandering the shadow lands for 15 years now, taking on what small quests they can while avoiding encounters with other dark elves at all cost."},{"name":"Mirmarye \"Mimi\" Sohuster","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Assassin","description":" As a young girl, dark elves raided Mimi\u0027s village, kidnapping her and her sister. Mimi escaped with the help of a dark elf warrior, who has since served as her guardian and companion while they wandered the shadow lands as refugees. Growing up on the move and among the rough and the lowly, Mimi became quite good at sneaking, stealing, and knifing her way out of many desperate situations.

Her widowed mother, unable to support her, left her to be raised as an initiate in to the Storm King\u0027s Temple of Winter as a small girl. By the aid of her instructors and her Northern blood, she has grown powerful: well-versed in magical lore, skilled in the healing arts, capable of manipulating the forces of winter, and deadly to the temple\u0027s enemies.

Rodagar is part of the band who plays for Lavisca\u0027s act, and the first time he ever saw her dance he fell in love."},{"name":"Gavin Burlester","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Wizard/Wu Jen/Warmage","description":" An aspiring young mage who believes that magic missile is the greatest spell in existence. A passing mage saved his life with one almost as an afterthought (it was his last 1st-level spell slot), but to Gavin it meant the world. He vowed that he would do whatever it took to learn how to cast magic missile (and only magic missile) as much as possible for the rest of his life. He has a younger brother who\u0027s a failed necromancer, who looks up to him and is trying to make his own mark as an artificer."},{"name":"Devin Burlester","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Necromancer/Artificer","description":" Gavin\u0027s younger brother who wanted to learn magic like his older brother could do. Unfortunately, the only one available to teach Devin was an old necromancer in the depths of senility, so poor Devin didn\u0027t get the best education. While trying to animate a cat skeleton for practice outside a neighboring town one day, a female elf druid caught him in the act. Rather than immediately condemn him for his unnatural behavior, the druid offered him a chance to just drop the whole necromancy thing if he couldn\u0027t get the skeleton to animate. He couldn\u0027t, and so the druid connected him with the town artificer, who he is now apprenticed to. His early efforts are poor but he shows some promise."},{"name":"Heaton Thorson","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Figher","description":" An extremely short, bearded fighter with a penchant for alcohol. He often gets confused with a dwarf, which makes him extremely upset. His code of honor is overly long and complicated, with rules such as \"Only fight Goblins with a hammer, never a sword.\" Ever since he accidentally burned his family farm down, (\"Never kill a rat swarm with anything but fire\") he\u0027s been travelling, looking to regain some riches."},{"name":"Sir Kagrok the Hairy","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Orc Paladin","description":" The nicest Orc you\u0027re likely to meet, as he is deadly determined to prove to you that orcs can be good people. A bit simple-minded and slow, but far from dumb. Holds honour, virtue and above all mercy in the highest regard, and believes orcs are not beyond redemption. Talks in simple but clear terms."},{"name":"Ketil Brokenose","genderRaceOccupation":"Male half-elf blacksmith","description":" Been in several too many bar fights. Earns a decent living by shoeing horses; spends a lot of it on ale. An honest and good man, who answers insults with a punch. Regularly donates money to the local temple but never attends sermons; he doesn\u0027t want some priest telling him to drink and fight less, and figures a sack of gold every once in a while should keep the gods happy."},{"name":"Rivik the Fox","genderRaceOccupation":"Female halfling ranger","description":" Served as a scout in the army during \u003cinsert war or large scale conflict\u003e. Called Fox due to her stealth, keen senses, and her bright red hair. Literally left the army; one day she simply packed her things (and a few other people\u0027s things, but she left letters of apology) and snuck out of camp to start an adventuring career. Now lives a solitary life of travel and adventuring, living off of hunting and selling animal pelts and finding adventuring work whereever she can."},{"name":"Teresa Greenreeve the Bastard","genderRaceOccupation":"Female half-orc bastard daughter and bard","description":" Bastard daughter of Lord Greenreeve and an orc witch.

Extremely helpful and kind, Grobby utilizes his strength and size to great effect at the farm."},{"name":"Tenzai the Lightningmancer","genderRaceOccupation":"Male tiefling druid-evoker","description":" Tenzai is fascinated by powers of destruction, specifically lightning. He lives in a ramshackle tree hut in a great oak tree in the woods where he studies the sky. Somewhat insane from isolation, his solution to most problems is to zap them with lightning. He is both a druid and an evoker wizard, as well as a brilliant scientist."},{"name":"One-eye","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Strumpet","description":" Taken from his people at birth by the humans, for they feared this \u0027exalted child\u0027 born of the elves. The elves, to save many sacrificed this one. Tall and hawkish, with a scarred face from years of rebellious actions, he has grown old, the humans who took him long since died of age. He has a photographic memory, he knows what you want, the question is if he cares enough to tell you. Raised in the Daddy-no-daddy orphanage on the outskirts of town One-eye began her life with a name, but since the incident the fuss about that has died down. Now because she\u0027s too old for the orphanage and too spoilt for marriage she walks the streets hoping to have a warm place to sleep at night.

The two mother/daughter and both advanced in age and nearly indistinguishable. No one, without expending some serious energy, has ever seen the two of them at the same time. They are soft spoken and gentle,, and turn a blind eye to the illegal activities happening within their inn."},{"name":"Facescar","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Thief","description":" High up on the food chain that is the Daggerford Thieves Guild. Has a scar in the shape of a smiling face, on his face. Speaks with a gravelly voice due to inhaling soot from his youth spent as a chimney sweep. Not above stealing from the poor, but tends to steal from the rich as they have better stuff."},{"name":"Helga Redeye","genderRaceOccupation":"Salty Pig","description":" Is somewhat ill-tempered and ugly, but secretly hopes one day a handsome adventurer will look past her physical flaws and love her for her true personality. Her true personality is that of an obstinate pig."},{"name":"Jennelles Silverstring","genderRaceOccupation":"Gnome Wizard","description":" A slightly crazy, but incredibly smart wizard who helps the party overcome challenges. However, his strategies are often dangerous, excessively complicated, and almost always involve the polymorph spell. He also builds magic items, though they are always questionably useful or sometimes horribly dangerous to use."},{"name":"Ronald the Shield Bearer","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Retired Adventurer","description":" A middle-aged possibly older man of a strong build. Ronald is an adventurer of the past generation and went on several heroic adventures. Though retired now he still helps out the adventurers cause. Motivating them with a story of his epic and daring quests, providing a first hand advice on a situation, or even helping defend the group with his signature duel shield style of fighting.

While never being successful or even very deadly he has always been a nuisance. His bandit group named the Jackals has fallen more times than people would care to count, but he always reforms it with young enthusiastic men. It seems that he has a terrible ambition of becoming a bandit of great renown, but instead is more of a figure of bad luck in the region he lives. The greatest feat of banditry the Jackals ever pulled was stealing a merchants wagon and kidnapping the merchant, but he took very little from the wagon and even let the merchant leave with his wagon after a day. As it seems Howard Jackal and his Jackals are just young men wanting the thrill of being bandit. If you ever run into him you are in for a long day, and you might even have a lighter coin-purse"},{"name":"Spike Jackson","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Frontiersman","description":" Spike Jackson is a man who from a young age decided to head out of the kingdom\u0027s main land to live his dream of being a frontiersmen. He grew a rugged beard and became incredible at riling up natives in the unexplored region. His goal on this frontier was to make sure that none of the natives would be in sight. He gave a proposition to every group of native species he met, either leave his king\u0027s land or die by his sword. Though remarkably hospitable to non-humans and half-bloods he will work with them if they agree in driving out the native population from the land."},{"name":"Molly Brevas","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Priestess","description":" Molly Brevas is a teenage girl who comes from the slums of the city. Her parents have forced her to spend most of her time at the local church, so she stays away from the crime ridden slum. The resentful of being made to volunteer she remains there cleaning and learning the faith in the church. Answering all requests made towards her with a sigh she continues what she sees as a boring life working in the church. The positive she sees to her volunteer work is that she probably would not be mugged like in other parts of the slums."},{"name":"Hlevar Silverton","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Silversmith","description":" Hlevar Silverton is a crafts-dwarf that like the rest of his family before him specialize in crafting with silver. Whether it is an ornate jewelry, or making silver arms and armor. Hlevar and the Silvertons before can make silver become whatever their customer requires. Hlevar himself is a dwarf set in his family tradition and refuses any assistance in his craft and preforms it like all his ancestors before him. The biggest change Hlevar brought to Silverton family was moving to the surface and selling his crafts more openly than his family before."},{"name":"Fatts Corkin","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Halfling Millionaire","description":" A bitter, old, corpulent halfling worth his weight in gold. Fatts has a stranglehold on the town or village where he lives. He secretly controls the government with his sizable monetary reserves. He talks like Pigma from Starfox 64. EDIT: 9 more coming later."},{"name":"Keruntilogrivex \"Runt\"","genderRaceOccupation":"Male goblin peddler, spy, thief","description":" Runt is an aggressively friendly and obsequious traveling goblin merchant. He never travels anywhere without his crammed wagon of merchandise. He has worked long and hard to earn the trust necessary to establish a sales route along the towns and homesteads of the frontier. Along with his legitimate business he operates as the hub of a ring of smugglers and thieves. He\u0027s not above murder or thievery, but he chooses his victims very carefully, and hides their bodies even more carefully. As far as anyone can tell, he\u0027s just an honest peddler making an honest buck selling honest merchandise."},{"name":"Raina","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Elf Bard","description":" Braided long auburn hair, blue eyes, tall and lean, no markings or piercings. Patient with the party to some extent, generally pleasant but ultimately has a hard time fully trusting the group with her needs. Wants to travel the world and capture stories. Is third in line for the elven throne, but has an older brother who she dotes on. He is generally much more sheltered and oblivious. Doesn\u0027t drink, doesn\u0027t stay up late, doesn\u0027t go out much in the evenings, but will accompany the party if asked. Has a soft spot for old people, including old dwarves."},{"name":"Urin","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Dwarf Merchant","description":" A horribly ugly, yet incredibly cheerful dwarf. Urin has ties to most major factions and a surprising amount of minor factions throughout the lands he travels. He has a thing for Half-Elves, is incredibly clueless when it comes to the significance of his products, (once mistaking an abstract representation of Orcus for an Amulet of Bahamut) and doesn\u0027t seem to have much business sense. Oftentimes he\u0027ll show his wares in small, poor villages that couldn\u0027t hope to afford any of his magic rarities, leading many to wonder if he even needs the coin."},{"name":"Aedonel Redcloak","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Elf Wizard","description":" An arrogant elven wizard who wishes to demonstrate his arcane prowess to any willing to listen or watch. He travels the world as a performer and mercenary. He doesn\u0027t enjoy fighting, but he does covet wealth and arcane power. He is liable to attempt contests of skill with other visibly skilled spellcasters."},{"name":"Omnibus Omberstien","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Knight","description":" A noble human knight who serves her liege-lord loyally, and often preemptively. She is liable to hunt down potential trouble before it even becomes trouble. This has been known to lead to both accolades and condemnation from the nobility, but her liege-lord has tolerated it so far. She is mildly famous in her home region."},{"name":"Zonia Ironmoss","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Dwarven Cleric","description":" A disgraced Tempest cleric who is seeking to regain her lost honor. She is focused and strong-willed, but lacks confidence during critical moments. She misses her family, and thinks the only way to see them again is to fix the mistakes she made, or make up for them."},{"name":"Miss \"Manticore\" Milesley","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Halfling Rogue","description":" A notorious halfling thief, she is known for both her peppy, friendly demeanor, and her propensity for effective, brutal violence. She uses a dagger and combat, and always seems to have another up her sleeve. She is wanted in several cites, but definitely has no trouble finding more people to rob."},{"name":"John Anderson","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Guard","description":" A relaxed town guard in a small rural town, Anderson is less interested in hunting evil than simply keeping the peace. He is a family man who simply doesn\u0027t want any trouble for his town, and is willing to tolerate adventurer-types as long as they spend their gold without causing problems."},{"name":"Urth","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Goblin Sorcerer","description":" Garth\u0027s elder brother, Urth is a rare Goblin with political ambition. He may be a petty warlord now, but he is clever and charismatic, and seeks to unite all goblinoids under a single banner, to crush the humanoid races and loot their treasures."},{"name":"Garth","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Goblin Rogue","description":" Urth\u0027s younger brother, what Garth lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sadism. As Urth\u0027s right-hand man, he does much of the head-kicking necessary to keep a goblin horde in line. He is feared by all local goblins, and more than a few local humanoids."},{"name":"Janus Timley","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Barbarian Mobster","description":" Janus is usually a ruthless, efficient, terribly refined mob boss. He puts on airs, and refuses all but the finest in food, wine, and women. He also hides something terrible. The eye of Gruumsh has looked long and hard upon this Half-Orc, leading him to fly into terrifying rages if the wrong buttons are pushed (his heritage, for one thing). He carries a cane, which he uses as a greatclub when he rages."},{"name":"Sharaa Silversword","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-Elf Ranger (Lycanthrope)","description":" Silversword is a famed hunter of monsters whose prowess is famous to local villages and woodsmen. However, she hides the fact that many of her narrow victories are as a result of her lycanthropic curse. The enhanced strength and speed come in handy when fighting the monsters of the forest alone, but she has claimed a terrible number of victims on the way. She wishes she could be cured, but fears for her life too much to mention it to anyone."},{"name":"Percival Aberdeen The Third","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome War Cleric","description":" Percival hails from a jolly family of gnomish inventors, who he is violently embarrassed by. To him, the greatest joy is to be found on the battlefield, the home of true invention and uncertainty. He is not well known by many (he has left his home far behind), but seeks the thrill of fair contests of warfare wherever he can find it."},{"name":"Skrillex the Enchanter","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome Enchanter","description":" A kindly elder has a bald head with a long white beard, he\u0027s old, hunched, the works. He is a simple enchanter, often granting +1 bonuses or elemental type bonuses to travelers and adventurers. He has nothing to do with Skrillex (the musician) from our world. He gets frustrated anytime adventurers ask him if he \"drops the bass\" or \"enchants people\u0027s soul with sound\" or other such crap. Often, he\u0027ll hike his enchanting prices for people who ask such idiotic questions."},{"name":"Seran Misherral","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Elven Commander/Bard","description":" A young slender figure with fair skin and blond hair (as most elves tend to be). She started her life as a bard, traveling from city to city spreading cheer and learning all kinds of valuable information. During \u003cinsert war here\u003e she was drafted into the military and lead into combat. Using clever magic and penchant for inspiring troops, she was able to lead a lost and recently leaderless squad fight it\u0027s way from behind enemy lines. Quickly she was promoted to real ranks of leadership, of which she rose higher soon enough. As it turns out, being a clever bard is incredibly useful in war-time. You know all kinds of \"useless\" trivia about your enemy, you better knowing how to think like them, and you have a plethora of unexpected magic tricks up your sleeves."},{"name":"Richard Gavel","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-elf Carpenter","description":" Richard is a younger male working the carpentry trade. He always carries a small red gem shard of some sort. He claims to not carry it for any particular reason, he just thinks it looks kinda cool so he keeps it with him. The one time it got stolen from him, he was kinda miffed, but not particularly upset. It was anonymously returned to him when the would-be thief discovered the gem lacked any real value."},{"name":"Mackrel Crackle","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Halfling Chef","description":" Mackrel is a simple chef who likes to pick up exotic spices from traveling adventurers. He offers discounted lodging and food prices for anyone who brings him spices."},{"name":"Bruthias Wainwright","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Playboy","description":" A rich business owner who spends his days partying around with beautiful women. He spends his nights sleeping in his mansion."},{"name":"Regand Algeer","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome Trapper","description":" A hunter-trapper who, strangely, wears regal clothing even while out hunting. His regal hunter clothes are more muted colors, but still brighter than you\u0027d expect of a hunter."},{"name":"Captain Ger\u0027Kro Mysl\u0027gat","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Elf Sailor","description":" A young elf in his early hundreds. He was abused and called \"old man\" by his previous captain and crew. One night, when they stepped off the ship, he used crew supplies and money to hire a crew of his own and set sail. He now goes from city to city hosting \"dock parties\" whereupon citizens enter the ship to enjoy a good party."},{"name":"Relic","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Teifling Guard","description":" Relic works dangerous night patrols, typically preferring to walk the city outer walls or traverse the more shady parts of town. No one knows why he goes by the name \u0027Relic\u0027 and he prefers not to share his real name (though he has admitted to having a different true name than \u0027Relic\u0027). Locals are familiar and comfortable with Relic\u0027s teifling heritage."},{"name":"Enpy Seenaim","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome Potionmaster","description":" He is a lone salesmen stationed on standard travel paths. He crafts all sorts of useful potions to be sold to adventurers. He lies about every tenth potion or so, completely fabricating the use and ability as he sells the potion."},{"name":"Damion Fireheart","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Bartender","description":" A retired adventurer, he opened up his own tavern/Inn, the Knife Tip Inn. Stays fit by fighting in the local arena, may be champion there. Motto is \"Fight, Drink, Sleep\" His surname comes from an old legend his family could preform fire magic without being spellcasters (which may or may not be true)."},{"name":"Gopnik Foulstain","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Half-Orc Sewer Worker","description":" Pleasant in demeanor, if not in odour, Gopnik might be the only person keeping the sewer system in Pipe\u0027s End from overflowing and fouling up the town. If only there were more strangely long-lived half-orcs with two centuries of plumbing expertise bumping about the sewers."},{"name":"Felegon Blade-of-Dew","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Eladrin Mercenary","description":" You offer Felegon a place by the fire, but he politely smiles and puts up his hand to refuse. As you inspect the coat, you realize that it isn\u0027t drenched in rain; an elaborate illusion makes it constantly appear slick with water. There is a practiced reserve to this seemingly young Eladrin, and you wonder what other illusions he maintains."},{"name":"Hipto Syliloke","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Gnome Underboss","description":" Hipto giggles, as gnomes are wont to do, but in an unexpectedly gruff tone for one his size. In many ways, Hipto appears to be more dwarven than gnomish, covered in dense fat and coarse hair. His sharp, Feyish features betray his true nature. He tells you he knows where to find your lost companions, but it\u0027ll be a hefty fee: Hipto trades only in rare Gnomish artifacts."},{"name":"Chainmaker","genderRaceOccupation":"Agender Tiefling Vigilante","description":" Nobody took the child seriously, not until they started donning a mask and righting wrongs in the town of Revenant Bay. Chainmaker barely acknowledges your presence, never breaking their solemn vigil. You see their back tense ever so slightly in anticipation as you reveal details about the job. In spite of the somber disguise, there is no masking the reckless enthusiasm of youth."},{"name":"Eva Slick","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Changeling Informant","description":" There is only one way to recognize Eva Slick - a secret known only to those she trusts most closely. Somewhere in her disguises is a small mark of the god Pelor, to whom she has devoted her life after being reformed. You knew her before she was locked up in the Solar Redoubt, and wonder what happened to rob her voice of its original luster and melody."},{"name":"Hansa Vel","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Courtesan","description":" She is not happy to see you here, let alone alive. Like a crimson star, Hansa rose from the alleyways of Karkenbad and into the bedchambers of its Crown Prince, climbing atop the bodies of her closest friends. You would not come to her if it was not completely necessary; there is no better assurance of that fact than the dearth of evidence you have assembled to blackmail her with."},{"name":"Yoldin Pippernock III","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Halfling Gentleman Farmer","description":" He saunters over to you, his entire body rolling and undulating. You could swear that, were it not for the hand he kept tight against his belly, Yoldin would simply burst in an eruption of jelly. Grasping his little, sausage fingers in an all-too-wet handshake, the master of Pippernock farms leads you through his famous plantation. The workers defer to this impossibly rotund man, and yet behind the smiles and courtesies is a wasting hunger, fixed pointedly on Yoldin\u0027s wrinkled, scrunched-up face."},{"name":"Felt the Dog","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Half-Elf Beggar","description":" Nobody seems to remember a time before Felt was Felt. She stumbled into the village, eyes fixed open in a permanent, vacant stare, and began barking and shouting odd, short phrases - things like squirrel, fetch, and bone. Henceforth, she was Felt the Dog, good only for begging and the cruel amusement of others. When she places a paper with the word \"HELP\" messily scrawled upon it, you look back at her, only to recognize for the first time the alarm in her nearly empty eyes."},{"name":"Ennarius Belechonia","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Elf (Rakshasa) Gentleman","description":" For a gentleman, Ennarius seems to have an oddly difficult time manipulating cutlery and working doorknobs. Regardless, you cannot help but feel warm and alive in his presence - generous, kind, and altogether lovely chap. Only time you\u0027ve seen him thrown off kilter is when someone mentions his income, which is a closely guarded secret. He only ever mentions the mines he operates, for which he recruits when in town."},{"name":"Rosaria Bone-Break-Crunch","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Minotaur Scholar","description":" A man walks into the library, and minutes later comes running out, screaming. You ready your sword and burst in, to find a massive, bull-headed woman sitting quietly, flipping through the pages of a book. She looks at your sword and rolls her eyes, droning out her monotone welcome speech for those visiting the Greenlake Academy."},{"name":"Leona Fleetskin","genderRaceOccupation":"Female, Changeling, Prostitute","description":" Well, here\u0027s my contribution! Might not be the best, but these are all off the top of my head so keep that in mind when you giggle at them. More Barbarian than Wizard, Krug has only the slightest touch of magic about him but desperately seeks to associate himself with civilized Wizards and Sorcerers. He travels from place to place telling fortunes for a pittance. He does this by gargling a bag of runes covered in Draconic script and spitting them one by one into a bowl then reading the future based on the way they land. These fortunes are very specific but usually about totally insignificant things like the hair colour of the next person you\u0027re going to meet or how many trees you\u0027ll see tomorrow. A handsome and charming middle aged man. Lon jokes that he obtained his name due to the combination of his dark complexion and good luck in games of chance. In reality he uses several enchanted items of clothing and jewellery to draw in and swindle the patrons of small town taverns, big city bars and everywhere in between. A 16 year old Changeling girl making the most out of her natural shape changing abilities and avoiding the mistrust most people have of her people. Leona has set herself up in the identity of a powerful Sorceress fallen on hard times. Using her \"magic\" to take the form of anyone her customers bring a detailed enough picture of/introduce her to. A massive step up from her humble beginnings as a street urchin Leona is enjoying the status her money has brought her and spends recklessly on anything shiny and pretty enough. However, despite this shallowness she secretly donates large sums to the church she and the other homeless children used to sleep in during the harsh winters."},{"name":"Jzarkey Padfoot","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Catfolk Shop Owner","description":" A short catfolk with a tail as long as his body. Fully prehensile and capable of lifting as much as his arms. Catnip addict, but it isn\u0027t obvious. He\u0027s willing to barter his wares for catnip if the PCs figure out that he\u0027s got a substance abuse problem. Has a collection of magical balls of yarn. Sells survival supplies like a ranger or rogue would use, including traps. He\u0027s got a basement in his shop that\u0027s protected by the very traps he sells."},{"name":"Scoggin Longmore","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Satyr Musician/Bard","description":" Travels from town to town. He is a lore expert about most everything though it wouldn\u0027t seem like it to look at him. He\u0027s introverted, except when it\u0027s performance time. He sings songs about things that couldn\u0027t possibly have happened though a sense motive check shows he\u0027s usually telling the truth. Has a magical set of panpipes. He runs at the first sign of trouble."},{"name":"Dr. Aveneros Charles Ula","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Eladrin Vampire Magus","description":" He\u0027s an avid art collector and despite being a total recluse, cannot resist following up on rumors of new artwork in town. He\u0027s charming, well-dressed, and aristocratic. Not the least bit pretentious. His appearance does not suggest that he\u0027s a vampire. Once a year, he hosts a gala for the territory\u0027s elite in order to show off his collection. He sometimes considers strange and rare creatures for his collection. He\u0027s on a 123-year mission to bring his wife back from permanent death. His castle contains an immense library of knowledge about the planes."},{"name":"Callidus The Bold","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Wizard","description":" Callidus created an underground sanctuary for a group of people needing to escape a cataclysmic event several millennia ago. He had planned on only needing to use the sanctuary for 20 years, but was instead locked away by his own mistake for much longer. He\u0027s gone cookoo crazy and is only alive because of a ring of sustenance and a time dilation spell cast on the sanctuary. He has a hard time believing that the outside is safe but is willing to help the players with anything they want if they successfully convince him to leave."},{"name":"Jarrell Blacksteel","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Blacksmith","description":" A gruff blacksmith, married to a sorceress. He is often found gnawing on strips of metal and has a somewhat arrogant demeanor. Once you get to know him he can be quite likeable, even though he is supremely confident in his blacksmithing skills to the point of annoyance to others."},{"name":"Mariel Blacksteel","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Human Enchantress","description":" Married to a blacksmith named Jarrell, she handles the enchanting part of the business. Very friendly and charming, she makes sure her customers don\u0027t get turned away by her husband\u0027s attitude. Her favorite part of the job is testing young sorcerers by selling them magical items they can\u0027t quite handle yet to see what happens. Sometimes the results are disastrous, but she doesn\u0027t seem to mind."},{"name":"Charles du Fromage","genderRaceOccupation":"Human Male Innkeeper/Ex-Adventurer","description":" A jolly fellow who has opened a tavern called the Laughing Pancake after retiring. He is friendly and open (on the surface, at least) and serves the house special, pancakes, every morning. To get some extra money in his pocket and excitement in his life he has become an information dealer on the side."},{"name":"Trinkle","genderRaceOccupation":"Gnome Male Wizard","description":" A timid and socially awkward gnome who was being tutored by the owner of a magical item shop. His teacher has since disappeared, leaving him to fend for himself and the shop, now aptly named \u0027Trinkle\u0027s Trinkets\u0027. He tries to keep things running on pure enthusiasm."},{"name":"Lord Vaskeron","genderRaceOccupation":"Half-elf Male Noble","description":" He had a pampered childhood, but it didn\u0027t last very long. After his family fell from grace he worked long and hard to get back where he belongs. Nowadays he is an influential man and he and his family are back to their old status. He is very much concerned with appearances. Occasionally, he performs a \u0027good deed\u0027, but he does those things for acknowledgement and attention only, not out of the goodness of his heart. He enjoys parties and spicy sausages."},{"name":"Anastasia","genderRaceOccupation":"Dhampir Female Adventurer","description":" Obsessed by knowledge, she has gone to great lengths to acquire ancient relics and artifacts. She will hire fellow adventurers to help her get what she wants, and discard them once she is done, unless they are genuinely interesting people (in her eyes). Few academics rival her practical knowledge on matters dungeoneering-related and she can take care of herself in a pinch."},{"name":"Boyd Bellamew","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Bowyer","description":" Boisterous and bold, he\u0027s a hard working bow maker. A bigger fellow, his belly bounces with laughter at his own crass humor.

She eats people because she learned an immortality rite from a forbidden book that involves cannibalism and blood sacrifices to her true god."},{"name":"Thenmozhibe","genderRaceOccupation":"Female tiefling moneylender","description":" Relatively tall with a wiry build, and no noticeable hair. Carries a many-notched steel staff of exactly five feet that she uses for taking measurements. Spends a month at a time inspecting roads and bridges and recommending changes around a town that hires her before moving on. Understands several languages but primarily speaks Dwarven in conversations with herself and others. His nose makes a faint whistling noise when he talks. Spends his evenings cleaning tables at a friend\u0027s inn in exchange for a room. Average height, broad shoulders, and shaved head with a large greying mustache. Has substantial savings that he intends to put toward building a house in the woods nearby. Twice married to human men less than half her age and twice widowed from duels in her honor. Wears secondhand clothes and jewelry from whichever town she last visited, to be traded in or sold for replacements in her current town. Talented flutist who takes pride in recognizing and developing the musical talents of those around her. Long brown hair, green eyes, and a permanently seductive expression. Dull-witted but friendly, and loyal to his friends and employers (in that order). Unable to speak any language except rudimentary Dwarven, though he understands orders as long as they are in Dwarven. His face is a misshapen mess of scars and broken bones that he has accumulated over the years, and his unkempt red beard has had chunks torn out of it. He is independently wealthy and spends coin generously, though nobody knows where or how he has amassed such a fortune. Short brown hair, a hawkish nose, and a large pair of canine teeth jutting up from her lower jaw make up an unusual visage, if not a particularly ugly one. She does not boast many clients, but those that pay will pay very well for her services - and highly recommend \"that thing she does with her teeth.\" Offers a money-back guarantee if clients leave unsatisfied, which no one has yet been able (or willing) to claim. Spends most of her free time passing by the homes of the nobility, admiring their gardens. Straight black horns follow his thin white hair back behind his head; rheumy brown eyes sit above a thin-lipped business smile. A team of apprentices run the day-to-day operations while he sits in the back of his shop, dreaming up and sketching fashion ideas. When a client of sufficient value enters, he becomes as authoritative and demanding as any tyrant, and will often simply forbid a troublesome client from speaking altogether; it is a testament to his prowess that business does not waver. He holidays with his paramour among the nobility once each year, whose identity he keeps secret largely for his own sake. Standing six feet even, Sash is heavily muscled and deceptively quick; her hair is tied back and she has silver tattoos over her arms and legs that stand out in stark contrast to her ebony skin. She\u0027s a bouncer for a tavern that sees very little business during the day, but much more when she\u0027s managing the tavern\u0027s fight pit after midnight. She regularly takes a week off to visit her family out of town, though once in a blue moon she\u0027ll take one of her many challengers up on their offer for a fight in the pit. Her tattoos are in Orcish - what she thinks says \"Swiftness,\" \"Vengeance,\" \"Fury,\" and \"Resolve\" actually says \"Fruit,\" \"Southeast,\" \"Brownly,\" and \"Dwwabmmh.\" Soft white scales run from the crown of his head and flare out all the way down his spine, while the rest of him covered in smooth, leathery grey skin. At his full height, he is a scale under six feet tall, with the tendency to crouch or bow his head to better hear those smaller than him. While young for his kind, he is very sickly; on any given day he might be sweating or coughing heavily, and he usually sounds exhausted. On rare occasions (months apart), he feels genuinely, truly good for days at a time, during which he shuts himself in his tiny home and works non-stop as his cultured colleagues await the results with baited breath. Short and stocky frame, with asymmetrical, broken brown horns that have been filed smooth. She can be very abrasive, and speaks openly about her distaste for her clients, her hired thugs, and the business of moneylending. She balks at spending money herself, though she is quick to jump on a deal if she\u0027s certain she can turn it over in her favor quickly. She refuses to deal in silver pieces, in an often futile attempt to invoke her demonic heritage for leverage."},{"name":"Lana of the Riverlands","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Watergenasi Hermit/Druid","description":" A weird old woman that lives in a small hole by the riverside. She takes care of the ecosytem of the riverland around where the river Vree flows into the Great Green Sea. She sees herself as the guardian of the river, having lived here for almost 40 years. She avoid human contact most of the time but some days she visits the town of Vreedam, where she tends to the sick and poor. Most of the normal citizens of Vreedam see her as a harmless nutter, but to the homeless, beggars and orphants she is seen as a kind of saint. Whenever she goes throught the streets there is allways a swarm or urchins surrounding her and she allways has some goodberries to spare. Her hair has turned the colour of sea foam and her sky blue skin has as many wrinkels as the sea during a storm, her back isn\u0027t what it used to be either so she is seldom seen without the driftwood staff she uses for walking. But her eyes are still the same as in her youth. Big eyes that catch the light and reflect it like a mountain lake on a windless day. Yet also deep and blue like the sea. Eyes that you could loose yourself in and drown. And many a man did back in the days. The old folk can sometimes tell of a time where every man was trying to court the mysterious lady of the shore. Yet none succeded. None but one."},{"name":"Kareem the Bright, Captain of the Ocean Dawn/Bard","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Fire Genassi Captain of a trading ship","description":" When he first arrived in Vreedam the news spread like wildfire, soon every young womans heart was burning with a passion. He was handsome, he was charming, he was exotic. In one word, he was hot. The Ocean Dawn hailed from Brangha, a big trading city in the far west. She was carring fruit, spices and silk of sorts people in Vreedam had never seen. The Ocean Dawn stayed in harbour for 3 weeks. Quite a long time. Why you ask? To celebrate the Dawns arrival the major decided to hold a massive party, it doesn\u0027t happen every day (or even year) that a ship from this far west found it\u0027s way to Vreedam after all. There was music and dance, food and alcohol, laughter and cheering. And at the center of it all was Kareem. Allways surounded by a flock of young woman, first dancing with this one, then with that one. Then he was gone. As if by magic. Which in a magic rich world like this seems actually quite likely ;) You see Kareem isn\u0027t actually quite the party type, while he loves to dance he doesn\u0027t like big crowds. He is honestly a bit of a loner. And so it came that on this fatefull night an again visible Kareem decided to take a stroll along the beach. And it was here, where the Vree joins the Great Green Sea that he met her. Deep Blue hair blowing in the ocean breeze, looking out towards the sea with eyes that reflected the moon and the stars. Their eyes met and Kareem could feel his heart skip a beat. The next day some folk reported seeing two figures dancing on the waves, only their silhouettes visible against the morning sun rising from the ocean. The Ocean Dawn left 3 weeks later, to travel to the Small Green Sea and sell the rest of it\u0027s wares and return a few weeks later to Vreedom to let of a single person and then travel back west to Brangha where it would have to find a new captain. This was the last anyone saw of the Oceans Dawn for 35 years."},{"name":"Jasper de Wit","genderRaceOccupation":"male human swashbuckler/rogue","description":" Blond, longish hair, slightly tanned skin, blue eyes, of average height for a 19 year old.

He left the town with 16 with little more then the shirt on his back. He returned 3 years later, wearing fine clothes and carrying a purse full of goldcoins. Some foul mouths would tell you that the ways he got this money weren\u0027t quite legal. They are right.

(The old mayor was fond of throwing parties for various ocasions using town money.) The Hummels have been a merchant family in Vreedam since its inception 300 years ago. They used to own the very first corner store. Where it stood before now stands the Hummel Trade hall, which hosts most of the trade going on in Vreedam.

You will usually find him either in the hall or at the harbour speaking to some merchant or the captain of a trading ship in their native language. Few people know that he actaully owes this gift for languages to a magic ring of languages that allows it\u0027s wearer to read any language and speak to people in any language they know.

At young age, she was chosen by Milil, and exiled from Drow society because of that. She prefers physical solution to her problems over magical ones, since she\u0027s a drow. She usually hangs out with bards, minstrels and artists, at local theaters and libraries."},{"name":"Grimey Folkhard","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Ghostwise Halfling Monk","description":" Back when Grimey was young, his father went travelling into world, telling him stories about a huge treasure he was going to find to make his family back in Shoun live a happy life.

Along the way he met Aiwin, who became his mentor on the way to becoming a true monk."},{"name":"Jens Folkhard","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Lightfoot Halfling Warlock","description":" Ashamed of not being able to keep up with traditions in their community of Ghostwise halflings, he contacted the Great Cthulhu and begged him for his powers. The Great Cthulhu gave him powers, in return for the rest of his life being his pawn in his great return. From time to time, he is asked to do seemingly ridiculous things that supposedly help in the summoning. Little does he know, the things he does today will have effects in the future - some in the closer future, some in further one."},{"name":"Aiwin Galanodel","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Wood Elf Mentor","description":" Four dots in shape of a letter Y on his forehead, the short black hair and the charismatic voice. Many people recognize him as the mentor of monks, who left monastery long time ago to spread his word through the world. He cares about his students, and always seeks for more. His secret hope is that one day, he will start his own monastery with his new philosophic views of the world."},{"name":"Mansel North","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Human Sailor","description":" When boarding the Red Sunset ship, you couldn\u0027t miss this tall pale human with athletic build and no hair on his head. He\u0027s got a tattoo of an anchor breaking through heart on his left arm just below the sleeve ever since his wife left him. Secretly, he believes that North Star is alive and that it\u0027s calling him. He is too quiet - he doesn\u0027t say anything unless asked to."},{"name":"Arno Bearkiller Kalukolake","genderRaceOccupation":"Male Goliath Adventurer","description":" Muscular goliath that stomps with each step, yet can move swiftly. He proved his adulthood by slaying Skrämbeorn, the great bear that terrorized villagers. Ever since then he was mistakingly recognized by the nearby villagers of Oxeye as a hero. He once got seduced by a dryad and how has half-dryad half-goliath son G\u0027rowt."},{"name":"Riva","genderRaceOccupation":"Female Drow Paladin","description":" She grew up to become a paladin loyal to her kind. Long white hair and dark skin may be classic features of a drow, but what could throw you off is lack of fascination for spiders. She\u0027s cold, shy and catious, but also inquisitive about the faith of others, but can tolerate paladins and clerics of other faiths. She talks in sleep about her drow friends she hasn\u0027t seen in years and is fascinated by birds."},{"name":"Maggi Swampbottom","genderRaceOccupation":"Female (Human...?) Vender","description":" A old, absurdly hairy woman, with grey hair covering her entire body, giving her a sense of mystery. Sells many magical items in her small indestructible wood hut, which can teleport to various locations (such as when PCs enter the town/city). Her wares are usually cursed in some way, and she is completely oblivious to such curses. Some are not cursed, but are usually sold at absurd prices."}]
