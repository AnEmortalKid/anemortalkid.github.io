</tr><tr>
	<td>Ebeneezer Meckinschmit</td>
	<td>Male Gnome Mad Traveling Wizard</td>
	<td> An old mad mage with a crazy accent. He travels in a wagon that looks splashed in dozens of paints, The wagon can magically open up on the side to create a market stall, complete with counter and a small set of stairs. Ebeneezer sells magical items, but always with a twist. Example: ring of detect fire, range: touch. He travels all across the land, and his wagon will occasionally shoot out fireworks.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Bryce Bladewalker</td>
	<td>Male. Human druid. Serial Killer.</td>
	<td> Favourite saying: The only thing I'll trust a woman to do is stay dead. Personality: A real go-getter, he can't stand laziness. Alcoholic. Widowed. Important memories: His wife, leaving him for a wizard whose every need was attended by magical servants. Strangling that wizard with his bear hands. An alcohol-fuelled haze of pain and regret.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Wine Barrelshy</td>
	<td>Male Human Politician</td>
	<td> A portly man with a knack for wining and dining with all of the city-elite. He is excellent at making friends and connecting people with other people. Well-known for solving the diplomatic standoff between a raven, four rival blacksmiths, and a large kettle of mutton stew. Despite his schmoozing, he has never tasted alcohol. He always acts like he is drinking it before pouring it discretely down his maroon-colored sleeves.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Elyss Iland</td>
	<td>Female Elf Recordkeeper</td>
	<td> Handles the welcoming of all newcomers to the Elvish lands and ensures that documentation is in order. Keeps meticulous records to the point of insanity, ie. Jerome's family biscuit recipe and Thurn's desire to have tree-limbs for arms. She is the source of the best gossip due to the collision of many backgrounds and personalities. Will often "strongly advise" that newcomers offer gratuity in the form of spoons - she has quite the collection.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Thall'um Pineleg</td>
	<td>Male Dwarf Craftsman</td>
	<td> Injured in the dwarven mines at a young age, Thall'um has permanent need for a wooden crutch. One end of his crutch is functional as a pickaxe, so he leans against the rock and picks with one arm. He is ambidextrous and a lover of symmetry; he will mine with both arms equally so as not to be disproportionate. His companion is a small, mute canary.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ronny Jainclout</td>
	<td>Male Human Weather-Enthusiast</td>
	<td> Born in a heavy rainstorm, Ronny has always loved the mightiest of Nature's squalls. Wears a tiny kettle on the top of his hat to collect rainwater - a drink he finds superior to all else. Terrible at small-talk because his idea of riveting conversation is what other people consider dull. Spends hours at a time staring longingly up at the sky before hastily scrawling out inaccurate weather predictions.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Q</td>
	<td>The crow may fly but does not speak, No secrets pour from silent beak..."</td>
	<td> Has an iron medieval plague-mask attached to his face, covering up long scars and awful burns - payment for committing arson. Can only speak in sing-songy rhymes: Plagued with bouts of fear and dementia and will often sit down and rock himself gently until his sanity is restored. Has acute memory loss which makes him a terrible candidate for acting. Instead, he helps the other entertainers in his troupe with various tasks and chores.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Reepa Featherlite</td>
	<td>Female Elf Repossession Agent</td>
	<td> A discrete "Repo-Woman" who reacquires goods through silent thievery. Often employed by the self-righteous elitists who tell long-winded stories of how they gained their wealth. If objects were gained illegally, she...takes the burden off their weak shoulders. She steals from the rich and gives to herself. It's the thought that counts after all, right? Along with her big-ticket items, she always tries to repossess sewing materials for her up-and-coming vintage money-purse business, "Featherlite Purses: So light you won't even know it's there!"</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Rodencha Kinsly</td>
	<td>Female Human Baker</td>
	<td> Absolutely LOVES cheese; can't get enough of the stuff. Incorporates it into nearly all of her recipes including apple pies, salads, and salmon bake. Is generally shy & timid. She doesn't like attention and will scurry away at the first sign of social interaction. Quite wary of wizards and magic-dealers in particular. Especially after she was inadvertently part of a wizard's mind-swap experiments. In other news, the experiment may have been partially successful and she may think that she's a mouse.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Amazing Prosto!</td>
	<td>Male Human Magician</td>
	<td> Wanders between towns and shares his magical talents with the world. His interest in magic peaked when his uncle pulled a coin from behind his ear. How did he do that?! Has a slight speech impediment, but it does not detract from his charismatic approach to wowing his audience with doves, rabbits, and paper bouquets. He humbly requests that parents refrain from speaking during his performances, since the reason of adults will ruin the experience for his target audience.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Gurglak Goggleschmitt</td>
	<td>Male Orc Artificer</td>
	<td> Use hands. Smash big stuff. Make small stuff from big stuff crumbs. Gurglak happy. Smash small stuff. Hands too big. Can't make no more stuff. Gurglak sad. Find new stuff.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ogrim Battlestroke</td>
	<td>Male Dwarf Mercenary</td>
	<td> Stereotypical warrior dwarf complete with expertly-forged armor and fearsome warhammer. Offers his services to all armies, with his preference being exotic and distant lands. Wakes up before sunrise on the day of battle, breaks out his canvas, and paints stunningly-detailed landscapes of the scene prior to being forever marred by blood and destruction. He sends these paintings back to his mother who thinks that he is merely a world-traveler who wishes to share his journeys with his only family.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Golly the Gambibbler</td>
	<td>Male Human Linthijaz</td>
	<td> Golly galumphs presently board he once brillig, tromping on loofus made twisty by twill, to trill at a boohome for russets and dogherous burbles.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Russel Folnhir</td>
	<td>Male Dragonborn Chef</td>
	<td> Large among the largest of Dragonborn, mightier than warriors, quicker than thieves, and smarter than scholars, Russel's ambitions lie solidly in the kitchen. He's often questioned about his peculiar life, that of choosing to be a chef rather than act on what appear to be a divine set of natural talents and opportunities. Russel is better than most at what he tries, but does not care to do anything but cook. He makes a decent sum from his job at a small town's community mess hall, though a lot of his work is done for free out of the love of doing it. Has a halfling wife named Margaret, who works part time as a lumberjack.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sifvilgyplidiven the Unpronounceable</td>
	<td>Male Human-ish Wizard</td>
	<td> Sifvilgyplidiven doesn't remember much of his parents, Tyghroiulmborttsmn and Yyyalianmmhjahtyrhba, but knows that his name has some greater meaning. He lives a simple life in an underground home beneath his pet project, a self-sufficient haberdashery catering mainly to the sale of hats. Despite being a wizard he is unable to do much beyond basic tricks, but knows more about obscure rituals and spells than anyone. He will teach travelers these things, but only if they can pronounce his name. Those who succeed also get a discount on hats.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>John Smith</td>
	<td>Male Human Commoner</td>
	<td> John constantly feels like the background character of a good book. His best friends Rydgar and Thorgrin the God Slayer seem exciting, living adventurous lives. In comparison, he's content with the simple 9-5 bustle of his medium sized town, his average home, and his hobbies. He collects coins of historical value, and has a large collection that he's quite proud of. John is so normal that he almost feels out of place. But then, how normal can he be? If normal is a barbarian devil killer, then isn't John abnormal? But that doesn't seem right. He is normal, it's the world that's strange! John wrestles with these thoughts often.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Mepis Soutan</td>
	<td>Female Half-Elf Journalist</td>
	<td> Journalism isn't exactly the most respected career paths in the world, but it's exciting. Mepis got her start writing for The Copper Pape writing about the unimportant nonsense of small town life such as which blacksmith was hammering who's codpieces. She caught a big break after securing an exclusive interview with Pelor, somewhat breaching her ethics policies by bribing him with the famous muffins of a local chef Russel Folnhir. She's now a columnist for The Astral Quill, and has been trying to secure an interview with someone that will take her career to the next level.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Eubor Westmin</td>
	<td>Undead Arms Dealer</td>
	<td> Eubor was once a person of some description, turned undead by some necromancer of some other description. He doesn't care for the particulars. Upon being raised, Eubor found that being an undead minion wasn't for him so he left to pursue other options. He now makes a living by taking weapons from dungeons, battlefields, etc and selling them. It's not a noble living, nor a living at all for Eubor, but it occupies eternity.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Yulmon Taed</td>
	<td>Male Human Author</td>
	<td> Yulmon occupies his time writing short stories, as well as occasional re-imaginings of folklore. His first book, The Boy and the Sweet +4 Shortsword was a big hit, giving him the fanbase to leave his miserable job as a haberdasher and write full time. He mainly sells his stories to The Astral Quill. Right now he's working on his first novel, A Game of Fancy Chairs.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Hirai Doyle</td>
	<td>Male Child Detective?</td>
	<td> Hirai is a child who calls himself a detective, and seems to possess intelligence and skills unlike any child should have. He also looks remarkably similar to a teenage detective from the area who went missing the same day the boy appeared, though with some glasses. This is of course just a coincidence, obviously. He frequently gets into dangerous situations, left to save the day using various gadgets created for him by his elderly gnome friend, Instructor Christie Herschel.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Daven Frealor</td>
	<td>Male Human Actor</td>
	<td> Daven is an actor, that much is simple. His real last name is Radtaie, but he changed it as there was already an actor named Daven Radtaie and there are rules to this business. He's considered semi-famous, holding a lot of minor roles in the big plays and some major roles in the smaller ones. His upcoming gig, standing in for a larger actor who quit acting to pursue a career in haberdashing, could be what he needs to break into the big leagues. His acting's fine, but he's just a bit too dramatic at times. If you want more detail, Mepis Soutan once reviewed his performance in Undeath of a Salesman.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Dot</td>
	<td>Male and Female Human Twins</td>
	<td> Pip and Dot are male and female, respectfully, and are identical twins. As kids it was cute, but as they grew older their interests diverged and now they just get on each other's nerves. Pip is an enchanter, and Dot is a ranger. Both are highly respected by those around them, and both are proper and well mannered. Put them together and they argue like children. Without having talked to each other in years, they each met and married one of a set of twins, Tim and Tammy, with similar circumstances and none of the four knowing anything about the situation. Coincidentally, Pip and Dot's older brother Jon is good friends with Tim and Tammy's older sister Jane, having met outside the situation. That first family reunion was a confusing one.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Laura Midsommer</td>
	<td>Female Human Basket-weaver</td>
	<td> She sits outside on clear days, weaving. With subtle yet somehow striking auburn hair, and a face rounded but fine. "The Jewel of the town" she was described. She is however as cold to others as the north wind.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Stonebeard</td>
	<td>Male Dwarf Mason</td>
	<td> "Stonebeard" not going by his birth name due to a contempt for his father who is considered "A lousy drunkard" even among dwarfs. Due to this he has a unusual fondness of "family values" and has a strong moral code. He travels around the human cities offering his extensive knowledge on stonework.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Antonio Pyre</td>
	<td>Male Human Acolyte</td>
	<td> Acolytes are often seen as unsociable to regular folk. Antonio is a man of common tastes, which has left him unable to gain higher status in his church. He would spend his evenings drinking and whoring. His sins should not be taken for complacency in religion, in his sinful conquests he would take the lowest of the low into the arms of god.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Evylin Silverwind</td>
	<td>Female Elf(?) Adviser-to-the-king</td>
	<td> A beautiful elf with silver hair flowing to her ankles. She is rarely seen far from the king, the few that have spoken too her see her as unusual. She is mostly unversed in human culture, unusual for anyone living in the heart of a human city.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Stron Leather-Arm</td>
	<td>Male Half-Orc Butcher</td>
	<td> Stron is a brazen fellow, harsh of word and sharp of tongue. Many distrust him as a half-orc, his profession does not help public opinion. While many butchers do not care much for the final product, Stron is a true gourmet, not cut of meat is too fine for his taste. He shares this only with his more friendly customers.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sapphire</td>
	<td>Female Human Prostitute/Spy</td>
	<td> Many prostitutes in the slums are driven to it by lack of options. Sapphire however has carved her own path from day one, she was a sharp young lady, too good for a brothel, but she was happy with it. After a few years, she knew how eager men (and some women) were to spill their guts. The lesson Sapphire learned was playing with politics was much more profitable.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Marrak Sunstone</td>
	<td>Male Human Arena-Fighter</td>
	<td> A man skilled in the martial arts is not uncommon, but one that can work a crowd so well is. A strong distinguished jawline and an even stronger voice. He is known for fighting with a falchion and sling, rather than the more common sword and shield.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Biri Bluebarrel</td>
	<td>Female Halfling Brewer</td>
	<td> From a long line of famous brewers, Biri is no less skilled. The fine blue-tinted ale her family is named for however is like poison to her tongue. Biri is cursed to never enjoy her gifts. She is loved by many, and despite not drinking makes any party lively.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Thalar Yet</td>
	<td>Female Dragonborn Wandering Teacher</td>
	<td> Thalar always found an odd love of humans, interested in their quarrels and struggles. She alone has become almost a legend travelling from village to village, every one left better off for it. She was taught well while young possessing great knowledge in healing, agriculture and combat. Thalar's love of humans even lead to her discarding the name of her clan for a name that humans found easier to say.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Skarrak Sunlight</td>
	<td>Male Tiefling Priest</td>
	<td> Masochist, is the one word that comes to mind when people speak of Skarrak. He is hated for his appearance, yet he retains a paragon of honor, virtue and piety. Through great pain he has removed his horns, over years cut away his tail. A man wounded in mind, some pity him above all others. (Phew 10, I should probably stop now)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sarim Marshwalker</td>
	<td>Male Half-Orc Ranger</td>
	<td> Lives on the edge of the swamplands, and will act as a guide for any who can pay a fair tariff. Though outwardly gruff, he can be fairly pleasant. That is, unless you ask about his scars... The last group to pass that way still haven't been found.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ravn Erickson</td>
	<td>Male Human Bard</td>
	<td> Old man Ravn has a tale for every night of the year, and knows more songs than there are stars in the sky. He wonders the northlands in search of heroes and adventurers to question, and will happily allow a road-weary party to share his fire in exchange for their story. His sage advice has more than once saved kingdoms from collapse, and is a welcome guest at any lord's dwelling.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Winna</td>
	<td>Female Human Barmaid</td>
	<td> Though she seems dim at first, young Winna is as sharp as a razor. She knows all the comings and goings in town, and rumour has it she knows the leaders of the Thieves Guild. Woe betide any who would raise a hand to her.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Valdi Galanodel</td>
	<td>Female Elf Ranger</td>
	<td> A strong but paranoid leader, Valdi is fiercely protective of both her land and her kin. She views outsiders with vehement disdain, and rarely allows trespassers on her land to pass unchallenged. Her pride has led to friction with the nearby human and dwarf settlements, and both are becoming increasingly concerned by her readiness to slay any who put so much as a toe across her borders.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Lord Kristian Fiermann</td>
	<td>Male Human Lord</td>
	<td> As corrupt as they come, Lord Fiermann sees himself a strong and capable man, though in fact his strength comes from his wife and her family, whose ambition far outstrips his. He frequently raises taxes to support his wife's "projects", and turns a blind eye to the numerous missing villagers who seem to wind up in his dungeons. He won't have anything to do with dark magic, though it is clear his wife is secretly attempting to summon demons to further her own goals.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Jackson Stern</td>
	<td>Male Human Miscreant</td>
	<td> Everyone in town knows Jackson, forever in trouble with the Town Guard. He's a troubled boy, and his petty crimes are going to see him hung. He strives to be the best thief this side of the Eastern Sea, but is so clumsy he mostly ends up causing minor damage to properties instead, before failing to steal anything before the Town Guard turns up to drag him back to the cell in the barracks. They joke he should be paying them rent.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Father Osmund</td>
	<td>Male Human Cleric (War Domain)</td>
	<td> Old Father Osmund is a devout racist. Though he outwardly strives to "better the world", he is zealous to the point of fanaticism. He can be found wherever there is a human lord looking to stamp out a local non-human community, or otherwise spends his time persecuting non-human members of society. He seeds rumours, sometimes even planting incriminating evidence in dwellings, before offering to be the one to deal with them once the mob is roused.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Tess D'Orvic</td>
	<td>Female Human Sorcerer</td>
	<td> Tess is the epitome of bad luck. Though she is one of the strongest sorcerers in the land, her art rarely manifests itself in the way she intends. She's on the run now, after that time she agreed to help deal with a ghost in the town cemetery, only to accidentally disturb all the other resting souls into haunting the town. When she reported to the council, so deep was her anxiety that her wild magic flared once again, and now none of them can talk, except to make farm animal noises. The price on her head is quite large these days.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Asher</td>
	<td>Male Human Rogue</td>
	<td> No job is too grim for Asher - for the right price he'll do almost anything. And he is good at what he does. Once the fee is paid, you won't see him again until the job is done. Don't expect him to stay quiet about it though. A few ales and he'll tell anyone anything.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Kydd</td>
	<td>Female(?) Human(?) Child(?)</td>
	<td> No-one knows anything about Kydd's origins. She is only ever seen before a town suffers a cataclysmic event, and stories of her appearances go back centuries. There have only been two occasions where she has spoken, and the persons to which she spoke became heroes of legend. No town has ever survived longer than 24 hours after she appears there. Perhaps she is the cause, or merely a warning?</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Estragon Morrins</td>
	<td>Mysterious Gnome Merchant</td>
	<td> A middle-aged man who feigns madness and sells an incredibly powerful poison known to cause septicemia which is in fact ditchwater.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Old Greg</td>
	<td>Generic Old Guy</td>
	<td> Greg is a generic old guy who sits in the corner of the tavern and occasionally shouts 'Lord Sprinkleton? Ah, not many people know the story of Lord Sprinkleton these days'. Unfortunately, he doesn't know all that much. He will only ever recount his childhood on the farm and explain vaguely relevant elven and dwarfish conspiracies because he is violently racist.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Rod Osmington</td>
	<td>Angry Merchant</td>
	<td> Rod has just escaped a troubled relationship with his father, in which his father decided to give him his full inheritance in chickens and land. Rod is now seeking people who will trade chickens for chicken food or actual money, and is therefore first seen leading thirty chickens or so. He does not like talking about it and will be gruff to any that ask why he has so many chickens.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>John the cat</td>
	<td>A Cat</td>
	<td> John is a cat, who will follow the party around. Flip a coin: Heads, he's the familiar of a suitably powerful wizard. Tails, he's literally just a cat. He is exceptionally stupid, and will often run off to stupid places. If the party decides to follow him around, he will consistently get them into trouble by biting important people, running away to secret bandit hideouts, and attacking the wizard's spellbook.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Triggart Darkfeather</td>
	<td>Tengu, Merchant</td>
	<td> I dont have time to do the Ten but Ill toss a few in here. Two of whom I played before starting DMing, Ive found them useful as NPCs because I like them. Small and pale and a great desire to be evil. Sometimes sides with good for his own later benefit. Wanted nothing more than to become a Lich god. Hated good Necromancers more than anything in the world. Hated his father for cruel magical experiments. VERY strong hatred of anything evil. Able to detect alignments, worshiped a troll god. Used a sword that was too big for him and was way smarter than him. After his people were killed he was raised from infancy by a gang of human thieves. Believed himself for a long time to be human, thinks everyone sees him as human. He often thinks he needs to explain to people that he isnt human. Because he was raised by humans he behaves like a human and not an elf. Mildly racist against any other race. See's Tengu as inherintly superior. Loves shiny things. Makes no bones about using other races for his own benefit. This is all I have time for. Id love to do more but maybe Ill comment again later if I can.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Vonrick the Valient</td>
	<td>Male Human Paladin/Knight</td>
	<td> Vonrick is the quinessential knight; he is tall, strongly-built and honourable as well as charming. He only hopes that none find out his gifts with the sword and lance came as a deal with a demon. The price was the life of his own brother, who Vonrick led to the lake and drowned as a young teen.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Old Obert</td>
	<td>Male Human Wizard</td>
	<td> While Obert is pushing 100 years of age, he will vehemently argue any claims that his abilities are dwindling. He spends most of his time alone in his tower outside of the village, trying to perfect a spell he had dreamed of years ago.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Peter of the Old Order</td>
	<td>Male Human Cleric</td>
	<td> Under his cream-coloured cloak and old roughspun tunic and with his gentle way of speaking, one may confuse Peter as a man against violence. However, he is a recruiter for one of the strongest military-churches in the land and had no qualms against wielding his hammer against those he sees as sinners.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sir Michael Mill</td>
	<td>Male Human Sword-fighting instructor</td>
	<td> Michael showed great promise with the sword in his youth, and was even knighted for his efforts in battle. However, at the age of 21, he stepped in a bear trap. The foot became infected and it was amputed. He now trains the younger boys in his town on swordplay.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>"Lute"</td>
	<td>Male halfling Bard</td>
	<td> A travelling singer and lute-player, simply known as "Lute". He chooses to follow adventuring parties for inspiration for new songs.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ella "Nightstinger"</td>
	<td>Female Half-elf Archer/Hunter</td>
	<td> Growing up as a Half-Elf in a Human village can be difficult enough, especially when one wants to become the first female hunter. However, her ability to hunt at night has earned her the respect of the others.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Keltrin</td>
	<td>Female Human Warlock</td>
	<td> Cloaked in blacks and reds, Keltrin always seeks out new cities to perform her dark magic. For a price, one can borrow her skills, but there is no knowing when your payment will be finished.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Quiet Ben</td>
	<td>Male Human Bodyguard</td>
	<td> Three things make Ben the outstanding bodyguard that he is: his bear-like stature, his loyalty to his employer and the day his father cut his tongue out for humiliating him in front of a Prince.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Maggie Bluestream</td>
	<td>Female Half-Elf birdkeeper</td>
	<td> Maggie is a Half-Elf. She understands that there are those in this world who do not take kindly to species-mixing. Her brother had warned her as much before he was captured in a raid when they were young. She has cut off the points to her ears, takes in the sun as much as she can, and plays the fool when she hears Elvish being spoken. She dresses herself in Human clothing, and has stopped practising any customs from her childhood. She has been put in charge of the messenger-pigeons for the Baron, and prays that one day she finds Elves contacting him, so she may try to find a home with people more accepting.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Khyban</td>
	<td>Female Dragonborn General</td>
	<td> Khyban was never meant to become a General. She had six brothers, all of them strong and capable of command. It was Khyban's lot to work with potions, or inter-clan diplomacy, or to help raise the younglings of her brothers. Dragonborn clans don't often look kindly on those who reject the role given to them. But when a Dragonborn returns home one night displaying the severed head of a Hill Giant, before they have even fully reached adulthood, it is impossible to ignore them. Khyban knows how to reward captains and soldiers who please her in battle. Displeasing Khyban rarely happens now.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sir Annory Garfield</td>
	<td>Male Human Captain</td>
	<td> Though his family name does carry importance in the kingdom, there isn't a knight who thinks Annory has earned the respect himself. Sir Annory has notoriously been part of battles that were already largely won, or were an easy victory. He has always requested to be stationed near less-troublesome areas. However, none of this works to lessen his arrogance, and he will inflate his achievements in battle whenever his honour is questioned.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Darber Claytop</td>
	<td>Male Dwarf Diplomat</td>
	<td> Darber is perhaps the only famous Dwarf in the kingdom who didn't earn such fame with a weapon. His crowning achievement thus far has been his negotiations with Karg the Big. Karg was an Orc chieftan who had grown his war pack large enough to threaten the city. However, using his snakelike tongue, Darber was able to stave off the Orc invasion for four full days; enough time for reinforcement cavalry to arrive and smash the Orc host. Darber now works within the city as a highly-respected ambassador.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Captain Bobbla of the Cerulean Shadow</td>
	<td>Female Halfling Pirate</td>
	<td> When she is in the company of other pirate captains, Bobbla will brag that her ship hasn't needed to seek a shore in over eight years. Her success with ship-raiding has been such that the sea provides all the treasure she needs. She leads her crew of Halflings in the long, blue-painted ship known as the Cerulean Shadow. If Bobbla wishes to remain unseen in a shadow, she will do so. If she desires that her ship remain unseen in broad daylight, it too will do so. No non-Halfling have ever survived once they step on Bobbla's ship, so the secret to the boat's stealth remains a mystery.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Gretchen Farseer</td>
	<td>Female Human Soothsayer</td>
	<td> Gretchen was once a talented seer for her marshland clan. She had correctly predicted bandit raids, locust swarms, plague, lightning storms and even wars. Her predictions have saved her clan innumerable times, and for this she has been treated with great reverence within her clan. It is a shame that her talents have dwindled with her advanced age, however. It has been four years since she has claimed to see anything but the supposedly incoming "ocean of fire".</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Elena Redlegs</td>
	<td>Female Human Goblin Queen</td>
	<td> Goblins attacker her village. Her daughter was killed in the raid by a Goblin chieftan. She begged her king for help, but none was provided.

Will no doubt be a legend in years to come. Very shy and has unfortunate bumfluff. Physically quite weak, and cannot finish a sentence without his voice cracking. Once was nearly killed by an Owlbear. Well known in his small town for bringing home large game from hunts with expert killing blows. Andre is a 1/10 ugly creepy dude with a smoking hot 10/10 wife. He was given the ironic nickname "Handsome" after he married his extremely attractive and loyal wife who is beloved by the town. Unknown to the townsfolk Andre made a pact to sell his soul to a demon when he was young in order to make his high school crush fall in love with him forever. (In my game he was a warlock but he doesn't have to be) He was an adventurer for several years, and uses the money he earned to make a living as a patron of local sculptors, masons and painters, paying their living expenses for an extortionate proportion of the profits from their work.</td>

The truth is this: He is a necromancer, whose spellbook is his own flesh. Spells are tattooed onto his body using the blood of innocents as ink. The main hint of this is that he does not have a spellbook. He is a generally kindly fellow with a cheerful attitude to life, whenever in company.</td>

	<td>Heaton Thorson</td>
	<td>Male Human Figher</td>
	<td> An extremely short, bearded fighter with a penchant for alcohol. He often gets confused with a dwarf, which makes him extremely upset. His code of honor is overly long and complicated, with rules such as "Only fight Goblins with a hammer, never a sword." Ever since he accidentally burned his family farm down, ("Never kill a rat swarm with anything but fire") he's been travelling, looking to regain some riches.</td>

Regularly donates money to the local temple but never attends sermons; he doesn't want some priest telling him to drink and fight less, and figures a sack of gold every once in a while should keep the gods happy.</td>

Tall and hawkish, with a scarred face from years of rebellious actions, he has grown old, the humans who took him long since died of age. He has a photographic memory, he knows what you want, the question is if he cares enough to tell you. Raised in the Daddy-no-daddy orphanage on the outskirts of town One-eye began her life with a name, but since the incident the fuss about that has died down. Now because she's too old for the orphanage and too spoilt for marriage she walks the streets hoping to have a warm place to sleep at night.

Along with his legitimate business he operates as the hub of a ring of smugglers and thieves. He's not above murder or thievery, but he chooses his victims very carefully, and hides their bodies even more carefully.

	<td>Male Half-Orc Bandit</td>
	<td> Howard Jackal for the most part of his life he has been a bandit. While never being successful or even very deadly he has always been a nuisance. His bandit group named the Jackals has fallen more times than people would care to count, but he always reforms it with young enthusiastic men. It seems that he has a terrible ambition of becoming a bandit of great renown, but instead is more of a figure of bad luck in the region he lives. The greatest feat of banditry the Jackals ever pulled was stealing a merchants wagon and kidnapping the merchant, but he took very little from the wagon and even let the merchant leave with his wagon after a day. As it seems Howard Jackal and his Jackals are just young men wanting the thrill of being bandit. If you ever run into him you are in for a long day, and you might even have a lighter coin-purse</td>

He gave a proposition to every group of native species he met, either leave his king's land or die by his sword. Though remarkably hospitable to non-humans and half-bloods he will work with them if they agree in driving out the native population from the land.</td>

The resentful of being made to volunteer she remains there cleaning and learning the faith in the church. Answering all requests made towards her with a sigh she continues what she sees as a boring life working in the church. The positive she sees to her volunteer work is that she probably would not be mugged like in other parts of the slums.</td>

Hlevar and the Silvertons before can make silver become whatever their customer requires. Hlevar himself is a dwarf set in his family tradition and refuses any assistance in his craft and preforms it like all his ancestors before him. The biggest change Hlevar brought to Silverton family was moving to the surface and selling his crafts more openly than his family before.</td>

He has a thing for Half-Elves, is incredibly clueless when it comes to the significance of his products, (once mistaking an abstract representation of Orcus for an Amulet of Bahamut) and doesn't seem to have much business sense. Oftentimes he'll show his wares in small, poor villages that couldn't hope to afford any of his magic rarities, leading many to wonder if he even needs the coin.</td>

	<td> Janus is usually a ruthless, efficient, terribly refined mob boss. He puts on airs, and refuses all but the finest in food, wine, and women. He also hides something terrible. The eye of Gruumsh has looked long and hard upon this Half-Orc, leading him to fly into terrifying rages if the wrong buttons are pushed (his heritage, for one thing). He carries a cane, which he uses as a greatclub when he rages.</td>

	<td>Female Half-Elf Ranger (Lycanthrope)</td>
	<td> Silversword is a famed hunter of monsters whose prowess is famous to local villages and woodsmen. However, she hides the fact that many of her narrow victories are as a result of her lycanthropic curse. The enhanced strength and speed come in handy when fighting the monsters of the forest alone, but she has claimed a terrible number of victims on the way. She wishes she could be cured, but fears for her life too much to mention it to anyone.</td>

He has nothing to do with Skrillex (the musician) from our world. He gets frustrated anytime adventurers ask him if he "drops the bass" or "enchants people's soul with sound" or other such crap. Often, he'll hike his enchanting prices for people who ask such idiotic questions.</td>

During <insert war here> she was drafted into the military and lead into combat. Using clever magic and penchant for inspiring troops, she was able to lead a lost and recently leaderless squad fight it's way from behind enemy lines. Quickly she was promoted to real ranks of leadership, of which she rose higher soon enough. As it turns out, being a clever bard is incredibly useful in war-time. You know all kinds of "useless" trivia about your enemy, you better knowing how to think like them, and you have a plethora of unexpected magic tricks up your sleeves.</td>

	<td>Male Eladrin Mercenary</td>
	<td> You offer Felegon a place by the fire, but he politely smiles and puts up his hand to refuse.

There is a practiced reserve to this seemingly young Eladrin, and you wonder what other illusions he maintains.</td>

	<td>Hipto Syliloke</td>
	<td>Male Gnome Underboss</td>
	<td> Hipto giggles, as gnomes are wont to do, but in an unexpectedly gruff tone for one his size. In many ways, Hipto appears to be more dwarven than gnomish, covered in dense fat and coarse hair. His sharp, Feyish features betray his true nature. He tells you he knows where to find your lost companions, but it'll be a hefty fee: Hipto trades only in rare Gnomish artifacts.</td>

Like a crimson star, Hansa rose from the alleyways of Karkenbad and into the bedchambers of its Crown Prince, climbing atop the bodies of her closest friends. You would not come to her if it was not completely necessary; there is no better assurance of that fact than the dearth of evidence you have assembled to blackmail her with.</td>

	<td>Male Halfling Gentleman Farmer</td>
	<td> He saunters over to you, his entire body rolling and undulating. You could swear that, were it not for the hand he kept tight against his belly, Yoldin would simply burst in an eruption of jelly. Grasping his little, sausage fingers in an all-too-wet handshake, the master of Pippernock farms leads you through his famous plantation. The workers defer to this impossibly rotund man, and yet behind the smiles and courtesies is a wasting hunger, fixed pointedly on Yoldin's wrinkled, scrunched-up face.</td>

	<td>Felt the Dog</td>
	<td>Female Half-Elf Beggar</td>
	<td> Nobody seems to remember a time before Felt was Felt. She stumbled into the village, eyes fixed open in a permanent, vacant stare, and began barking and shouting odd, short phrases - things like squirrel, fetch, and bone. Henceforth, she was Felt the Dog, good only for begging and the cruel amusement of others. When she places a paper with the word "HELP" messily scrawled upon it, you look back at her, only to recognize for the first time the alarm in her nearly empty eyes.</td>

Regardless, you cannot help but feel warm and alive in his presence - generous, kind, and altogether lovely chap. Only time you've seen him thrown off kilter is when someone mentions his income, which is a closely guarded secret. He only ever mentions the mines he operates, for which he recruits when in town.</td>

	<td> Well, here's my contribution! Might not be the best, but these are all off the top of my head so keep that in mind when you giggle at them. More Barbarian than Wizard, Krug has only the slightest touch of magic about him but desperately seeks to associate himself with civilized Wizards and Sorcerers. He travels from place to place telling fortunes for a pittance. He does this by gargling a bag of runes covered in Draconic script and spitting them one by one into a bowl then reading the future based on the way they land. These fortunes are very specific but usually about totally insignificant things like the hair colour of the next person you're going to meet or how many trees you'll see tomorrow. A handsome and charming middle aged man. Lon jokes that he obtained his name due to the combination of his dark complexion and good luck in games of chance. In reality he uses several enchanted items of clothing and jewellery to draw in and swindle the patrons of small town taverns, big city bars and everywhere in between. A 16 year old Changeling girl making the most out of her natural shape changing abilities and avoiding the mistrust most people have of her people. Leona has set herself up in the identity of a powerful Sorceress fallen on hard times. Using her "magic" to take the form of anyone her customers bring a detailed enough picture of/introduce her to. A massive step up from her humble beginnings as a street urchin Leona is enjoying the status her money has brought her and spends recklessly on anything shiny and pretty enough. However, despite this shallowness she secretly donates large sums to the church she and the other homeless children used to sleep in during the harsh winters.</td>

Not the least bit pretentious. His appearance does not suggest that he's a vampire. Once a year, he hosts a gala for the territory's elite in order to show off his collection.

He had planned on only needing to use the sanctuary for 20 years, but was instead locked away by his own mistake for much longer. He's gone cookoo crazy and is only alive because of a ring of sustenance and a time dilation spell cast on the sanctuary. He has a hard time believing that the outside is safe but is willing to help the players with anything they want if they successfully convince him to leave.</td>

	<td>Female Human Enchantress</td>
	<td> Married to a blacksmith named Jarrell, she handles the enchanting part of the business. Very friendly and charming, she makes sure her customers don't get turned away by her husband's attitude.

Nowadays he is an influential man and he and his family are back to their old status. He is very much concerned with appearances.

She will hire fellow adventurers to help her get what she wants, and discard them once she is done, unless they are genuinely interesting people (in her eyes).

	<td>Silver Sash</td>
	<td>Female human bouncer</td>
	<td> Relatively tall with a wiry build, and no noticeable hair. Carries a many-notched steel staff of exactly five feet that she uses for taking measurements. Spends a month at a time inspecting roads and bridges and recommending changes around a town that hires her before moving on. Understands several languages but primarily speaks Dwarven in conversations with herself and others. His nose makes a faint whistling noise when he talks. Spends his evenings cleaning tables at a friend's inn in exchange for a room. Average height, broad shoulders, and shaved head with a large greying mustache. Has substantial savings that he intends to put toward building a house in the woods nearby. Twice married to human men less than half her age and twice widowed from duels in her honor. Wears secondhand clothes and jewelry from whichever town she last visited, to be traded in or sold for replacements in her current town. Talented flutist who takes pride in recognizing and developing the musical talents of those around her. Long brown hair, green eyes, and a permanently seductive expression. Dull-witted but friendly, and loyal to his friends and employers (in that order). Unable to speak any language except rudimentary Dwarven, though he understands orders as long as they are in Dwarven. His face is a misshapen mess of scars and broken bones that he has accumulated over the years, and his unkempt red beard has had chunks torn out of it. He is independently wealthy and spends coin generously, though nobody knows where or how he has amassed such a fortune. Short brown hair, a hawkish nose, and a large pair of canine teeth jutting up from her lower jaw make up an unusual visage, if not a particularly ugly one. She does not boast many clients, but those that pay will pay very well for her services - and highly recommend "that thing she does with her teeth." Offers a money-back guarantee if clients leave unsatisfied, which no one has yet been able (or willing) to claim. Spends most of her free time passing by the homes of the nobility, admiring their gardens. Straight black horns follow his thin white hair back behind his head; rheumy brown eyes sit above a thin-lipped business smile. A team of apprentices run the day-to-day operations while he sits in the back of his shop, dreaming up and sketching fashion ideas. When a client of sufficient value enters, he becomes as authoritative and demanding as any tyrant, and will often simply forbid a troublesome client from speaking altogether; it is a testament to his prowess that business does not waver. He holidays with his paramour among the nobility once each year, whose identity he keeps secret largely for his own sake. Standing six feet even, Sash is heavily muscled and deceptively quick; her hair is tied back and she has silver tattoos over her arms and legs that stand out in stark contrast to her ebony skin. She's a bouncer for a tavern that sees very little business during the day, but much more when she's managing the tavern's fight pit after midnight. She regularly takes a week off to visit her family out of town, though once in a blue moon she'll take one of her many challengers up on their offer for a fight in the pit. Her tattoos are in Orcish - what she thinks says "Swiftness," "Vengeance," "Fury," and "Resolve" actually says "Fruit," "Southeast," "Brownly," and "Dwwabmmh."</td>

She avoid human contact most of the time but some days she visits the town of Vreedam, where she tends to the sick and poor. Most of the normal citizens of Vreedam see her as a harmless nutter, but to the homeless, beggars and orphants she is seen as a kind of saint. Whenever she goes throught the streets there is allways a swarm or urchins surrounding her and she allways has some goodberries to spare. Her hair has turned the colour of sea foam and her sky blue skin has as many wrinkels as the sea during a storm, her back isn't what it used to be either so she is seldom seen without the driftwood staff she uses for walking. But her eyes are still the same as in her youth. Big eyes that catch the light and reflect it like a mountain lake on a windless day. Yet also deep and blue like the sea. Eyes that you could loose yourself in and drown. And many a man did back in the days. The old folk can sometimes tell of a time where every man was trying to court the mysterious lady of the shore. Yet none succeded. None but one.</td>

In one word, he was hot. The Ocean Dawn hailed from Brangha, a big trading city in the far west. She was carring fruit, spices and silk of sorts people in Vreedam had never seen. The Ocean Dawn stayed in harbour for 3 weeks. Quite a long time. Why you ask? To celebrate the Dawns arrival the major decided to hold a massive party, it doesn't happen every day (or even year) that a ship from this far west found it's way to Vreedam after all. There was music and dance, food and alcohol, laughter and cheering. And at the center of it all was Kareem. Allways surounded by a flock of young woman, first dancing with this one, then with that one. Then he was gone. As if by magic. Which in a magic rich world like this seems actually quite likely ;) You see Kareem isn't actually quite the party type, while he loves to dance he doesn't like big crowds. He is honestly a bit of a loner. And so it came that on this fatefull night an again visible Kareem decided to take a stroll along the beach. And it was here, where the Vree joins the Great Green Sea that he met her. Deep Blue hair blowing in the ocean breeze, looking out towards the sea with eyes that reflected the moon and the stars. Their eyes met and Kareem could feel his heart skip a beat. The next day some folk reported seeing two figures dancing on the waves, only their silhouettes visible against the morning sun rising from the ocean. The Ocean Dawn left 3 weeks later, to travel to the Small Green Sea and sell the rest of it's wares and return a few weeks later to Vreedom to let of a single person and then travel back west to Brangha where it would have to find a new captain. This was the last anyone saw of the Oceans Dawn for 35 years.</td>

	<td>Male Half-elf Sorcerer</td>

He's young, but not quite young enough to justify wearing all black, being very angsty, and referring to himself in the third-person by a superhero-esque monicker.

With a faint accent, one of his family's twin ancestral swords, and a spring in his step, he jaunts from city to city. Many fans of his are eager to throw parties in his name, an honor he doesn't seem to mind. However, his family back home, specifically his brother, the lord of the island, are none too happy that Veylin took one of the ancestral swords that are rightfully his, and left the line of succession to go off on what is (in their eyes) quite a silly occupation.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Pallen "Silvertongue"</td>
	<td>Male Halfling Gang Leader</td>
	<td> Those who see Pallen for the first time assume him to be a perfectly nice man. Why, he would never hurt a fly. However, those unlucky tavern owners and innkeepers who live in the same neighborhood as him know him as a ruthless man who will do anything for money and power, and half the inns and taverns owe him protection money. But most just see his friendly exterior, a happy face, an easy smile and the famous sharp tongue that gives him his nickname and pass him on by.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Stalwart</td>
	<td>??? Warforged Butler</td>
	<td> Stalwart is the longtime manservant and butler of a high-ranking lord of a noble family. The one thing that separates him from most of his brethren is his remarkably sharp tongue and cynical and sarcastic sense of humor. No one knows quite how a member of this normally humorless race developed such a wit, but it is clear that his sense of humor is quite developed, often surpassing the wit of his employer. Many fellow nobles call on the employer just to hear what Stalwart mutters under his breath, and several family friends think of Stalwart in as high if not higher regards as they do the actual family.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Torrek Holdeger</td>
	<td>Male dwarf armorer</td>
	<td> The dwarf pensively strokes his neatly kept long mustaches of dark brown that twist into the long braid of his beard. Torrek was trained by one of the finest armorer's in his kingdom and is a master craftsman. As a refugee, he's been reduced to accepting mostly journeymen work; he hopes to set up his own forge and armory in the near future.

	<td>Torgrim Holdeger</td>
	<td>Male dwarf soldier</td>
	<td> The especially broad-shouldered dwarf in mail wears his black beard straight and neatly combed out; his eyes twinkle merrily from beneath his finely-made helm, his cheeks rosy with drink. Having escaped the destruction of his clan and kingdom with his brother, Torgrim now assists his brother at the various forges where he finds work and accepts odd jobs as a guard or enforcer. He has some rudimentary training as a healer, but he's not particularly good. Torgrim is oft-times jealous of his brother's talents; he is loathe to admit when he's wrong, especially in front of his brother.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Jurk, the Ironbiter</td>
	<td>Male dwarf berserker</td>
	<td> The dwarf stares off at nothing in particular, twirling his fingers in his long auburn beard, tied into two uneven, snaky ropes (no one would call them braids). If the crazy look in his eye doesn't suggest to you that he might not be all there, the string of desiccated ears around his neck will. Jurk does not talk much; he is the last of his clan, and one of the few survivors of a dwarvish kingdom that was overrun by goblins. He became a bit unhinged a bit during the Goblin Wars and cannot even remember his clan's name, but he remembers his king and will defend his king's name fearlessly.</td>
