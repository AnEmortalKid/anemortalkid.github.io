<tbody><tr>
<td>Mamanto Tharl</td>
<td>Etiquette and Subterfuge</td>
<td> A haughty Elven dandy, Mamanto struts in front of his class, demonstrating how one walks like a noble. Sporting a frilled lilac chemise and skin tight black leggings, Mamanto projects his voice with volume and enunciates every instruction to his students like a real nobleman. "Walk like them, talk like them or else you'll never get within a mile of them!" His students try their best to focus, but his overpowering perfume clouds the air and dulls their senses. A similar perfume is given to promising students as a graduation gift; an alchemical concoction made to daze and distract those nearby, and mask the scent of any noxious poison one might carry.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Professor Koro</td>
<td>Working in groups</td>
<td> The professor is not human, but some kind of aberrant squid from the far realms with immense power; he can move with blinding speed, is entirely immune to normal damage, and can channel his power into enormous explosions capable of destroying mountains. Koro is recognizably a threat to the entire world, but he teaches his class how to work together during assassinations to be able to accomplish feats they never could on their own, with the end goal being his own assassination at their hands. No class has ever been successful, but each gets slightly closer, and graduates with far more skill than most assassins who do not take the course.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>never</td>
<td>Cleaning</td>
<td> When teaching, there is always a scenario prepared, frequently from other instructors homework. He will point at important details such as spills or small 'evidence' (hair, dust, footprints, etc.), make demonstrations with various potions and magic items, and then leave the students to figure out what he means, only giving approving nods or disapproving stares. He will use useful magic for ease, but will never use verbal spells. Students tend to learn how to use corrosive potions, blood sponges, incinerators, spells (if capable), disintegration effects, flooding techniques, using bags of holding for corpses, and, if present in the world, basic knowledge of a sphere of annihilation in order to permanently destroy all that enters its shadowy domain.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Drek</td>
<td>Theatricality</td>
<td> A lean muscled half-orc with a penchant for the dramatic. Named himself Drek, which translates into "worthless" in orcish, out of a constant melodramatic hate for his bloodline. "Smoke and mirrors are just as valuable as a blade" Teaches his students how to pull off a job in the most over the top way possible. Those who graduate from his course can make a kill look like an act of the gods, a devil's command, and anything in between. This course tends to attract mopey lone-wolf types.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dingo "Silentfart" Nackle</td>
<td>Assasination in public</td>
<td> Dingo is a smart and light hearted Gnome with bright, well trimmed hair, and sparkling green eyes. Excels at killing targets unnoticed, and finds great entertainment in taking out political targets among nobles. He's good with poison, and enjoys to use fairly unnoticeable tricks to kill his targets. Probably one of the most energetic lecturers, but tends to get really off topic, and regularly pranks his students.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Oleg Bluntaxe</td>
<td>Hitting people hard with an axe until they die</td>
<td> Sometimes all you need is to kill someone without any form of grace to make an example, and Oleg is the man for just that. He's a bald, dimwitted ex-lumberjack, with scruffy beard and has a great passion for chopping more than just trees. Lectures usually revolve around hitting stuff. Hard.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Toren Brightglow</td>
<td>Dinner Etiquette</td>
<td> Toren is a light haired, big bellied, constantly smiling dwarf. He teaches the proper methods of preparing a dinner for high class targets. The class focuses on such things as creating a menu, proper cooking techniques, silverware placement, and how to conduct light conversation. He makes each student throw a dinner party for the class each week, though its usually better to go hungry if you can't figure out if the nightshade is in the sea bass or the soup.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solana Ashaar</td>
<td>Long Distance Targeting (Sniping)</td>
<td> A cheerful half-elf with fiery red hair, unkempt and cut short. She is usually pleasant to be around, and she helps those who ask for it, but when she is serious about a topic she is intimidating. Students will need to have saintly patience and be prepared for plenty of... unorthodox training methods, as sniping isn't exactly a straightforward technique to teach.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sam</td>
<td>Deception and Illusion</td>
<td> While it is true that being a doppleganger Sam has an unfair advantage that they cannot teach to their students. Sam only takes in students with the drive to use spells such as "disguise self" and "polymorph." Sam teaches that nearly anything can be hidden in plain sight, from the people next to you to the weapons on your person. Sam has a tendency to walk into the first day of class as a student in naught but their uniform, and then walks to the front of the class and pulls out all manor of weapons from misc. polymorphed items. They also teach a class on conjuration for the higher level students.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Velyr</td>
<td>"You never climb a castle wall without knowing what you'll find on the other side. Many of your contracts will prevent you from simply murdering your target, my love. I assure you that, with the letters you write, you can kill without a weapon, from any distance."</td>
<td> Velyr is, by all appearances, human. He seems to have short hair, trimmed beard, and very well fitted dress. His manners are fluid, automatic, and above all precise. By all appearances, he would pass by unnoticed in any crowd of well-to-do citizens. By all appearances, he has a warm, soothing voice which makes those unwary feel safe near him. The close observer, however, may find his cold stare and toothy grin unnatural.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>MINIMUM!!"</td>
<td>"Which reminds me of how i lost my leg. You see..."</td>
<td> He is, however, an altogether wonderful guy once you get to know him. His classes, while challenging, are always reasonable and he takes a lighthearded approach to economic math. When he digresses though, his stories get a bit... intense. It's the mood swings, probably- or perhaps the whisky. Or maybe it's due to sudden, crashing memories of his past. It's tough to say.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Varus Senepes</td>
<td>"Vivian you do realize that you have FAILED... to sterilize your knife, upon puncturing your finger? Supposing you did the mix CORRECTLY... you will be dead in thirty seconds, unless you prepare your antidote with... legendary, speed. ...Miss Vivian I do believe you have just committed not ONLY to the failure of this course but your own demise as well. Drink this... now leave, before I decide to make YOU my next... ingredient."</td>
<td> Alchemy, poisons and oils. Varus is a black haired, pale, centuries old elf, who talks with quite... pronounced... articulation. His robes hide his features so well he appears as a specter most days, if he appears at all. It amuses him to teach while invisible, to better catch slacking or cheating students. Incidentally, it also aids with visual demonstrations some days. His class is the most difficult to pass in the entire academy, due to the rigorous study and absolutely vicious classes. Being called upon to recite ingredients or cooking methods is quite dreaded, as failure could mean imbibing any number of potions to demonstrate the antidote application method. It would be quite an odd semester if every student survived, though Varus has never deliberately killed any of them. Yet, anyway.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Loraine "Doc" Highfellow</td>
<td>Practical Anatomy</td>
<td> A former medical practitioner during the days of the Great plague, Loraine is cold, calculating, and unforgiving. She is a slender human woman, rather unremarkable looking, with brown eyes and shoulder-length black hair. The first day of her class is infamous among students, as she brings in two live humanoid subjects, and orders a student to attempt to kill one by stabbing them once. Often, it results in several minutes of agonized screaming from the victim, during which Loraine proceeds to demonstrate the importance of a thoughtfully-placed knife, ending the other subject's life quickly and quietly in naught but a few seconds. Her final exam can be heard throughout the school as, for a brief moment, dozens of people cry out in pain and fear before their lives are swiftly and efficiently snuffed by the students.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Darrio</td>
<td>Culinary Animosity</td>
<td> Darrio is a human male of average build with slightly graying hair. He is most often see dressed white, the way you would expect any good chef or cook to be. The first few weeks of his class always start with regular cooking lessons, to make sure the students can actually pass as, at the least, competent cooks. From there, he moves on to teaching them how to mix various ingredients into the food, to produce non-fatal effects such as diarrhea or vomiting without any noticeable unusual taste. The final portion of the course is fatal poisoning, by method. Successful students can induce death that looks like choking, heart attack, or almost any natural means. The absolute top students are those that can tailor mass consumption meals to specific individuals: A soup that targets only the duchess, bread rolls that only asphyxiate the diplomat from the foreign country, wine that only burns the esophagus of the famously vain opera singer, etc.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mordak Chainboot</td>
<td>Prison Infiltration and Breakout</td>
<td> Mordak is a worn, sickly-looking dwarf with a smoky-gray beard barely longer than a stubble. In his lectures, he has a tendency to wax on about his own claim to fame: infiltrating a supposedly inescepable dwarven prison and breaking out after assassinating his mark. Despite the occasional reminiscing, his lessons do cover all the aspects of assassinating an imprisoned mark, from techniques to learn the prison layout in preparation, to various ways of securing an unguarded moment with the mark to carry out the assassination.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jiang of the Silent Afterlife</td>
<td>Professor of Making Sure Dead Men Tell No Tales</td>
<td> In a world where ghosts exist, it can be hard for assassins to maintain their anonymity when their victim's spirit can still point fingers. Jiang has mastered the arcane arts of keeping ghosts silent, often by destroying the ghost as soon as the spirit leaves the body or by destroying the spirit before the body dies. She honed her ghost-slaying talents under the tutelage of a temple to Pelor, and has learned arcane rites to hurry a soul into its proper afterlife, where it can't tell stories, in a temple to the Raven Queen. Her classes tend to be underfilled, as few respect the value of her lessons until a paranormal investigation begins, and the spirit is at large.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rylni of Grayshear</td>
<td>Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, teaches Scrying Ia</td>
<td> This beady eyed gnome wears a light gray robe that contour her body just enough to reveal a gaunt figure unfit for strenuous work, unlike others at the academy. She has an oily and freckled face which both accentuate a scar that runs from her jaw line to her right cheek bone. Often mistaken for a student, Rylni distinguishes herself through her unforgettably explosive temper when she's outspoken. Rylni has the difficult task of performing fact checks on instructors who applied to the academy. Students taking her class learn elementary applications of the scrying orb, amongst other divination tricks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lokeris Dark (the third)</td>
<td>Justification</td>
<td> A silver-tongued Tiefling fellow, always dressed impecably in the finest clothes, elven in style of course. His manners, always impecable, are totally disarming, charming even the most savage of beasts. His wit sharper than the finest blades the forgotten realms could offer. And there's the rub. You see, learning to kill subtly is one thing, learning to give a reason to kill is another. Under Lokeris' tutelage, students will learn how find their target's weak spot, whether it be cards, dice, or just their honour, and exploit it, needle at it until the target attacks. Remember, it isn't murder if it's self defense.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Matron Sarah</td>
<td>Common folk manipulation and political subterfuge</td>
<td> Matron Sarah is an elderly human, previously married to a farmer before he and her children were murdered by soldiers of his lord. She has a kind smile and kinder eyes, and teaches the better off students how to fraternize with peasants and urchins. This is a unique brand of assassination she teaches; turning once loyal subjects against their leaders, typically through violent revolution. Despite this facade, she cares little for the well being of the people, only taking pleasure in the upsetting of power balances and political instability that follows. The loss of her family broke her, and she sought vengeance by making a pact with a particularly capricious fey in exchange for the power to rein chaos on the material plane.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Therian the Flame</td>
<td>Making it look like an accident</td>
<td> Seen as a joke by the other teachers LoneStar is, nonetheless, One of the most well known assassins ever. LoneStar's reputation exceeds his actual success rate by many levels, however. LoneStar teaches that one must take pride in their work, and everyone should know who killed the mark. Studebts practice boisterous monologues while hanging from rafters, taunting their target while it summons its guards, and develop their own flamboyant "signature technique" with its own equally edgy name.   Therian is a middle aged man, brown hair and bronze skin. He only wears a pair of white baggy clith pants, and his scimitar strapped to his waist. Therians class teaches students how to best utilize poor building techniques, such as weak foundations, or wood structural beams, to literally "bring the house down" on their target. Graduates of this class go on to become Expert serial arsonists and impromptu demolitions crews, as well as being highly sought after sappers in times of war.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Daven of Crowbridge</td>
<td>does</td>
<td> Jethro Eckhardt is a lean, bespectacled, scholarly looking sort, often dressed in doctor's robes and accompanied by his distinctly humanoid Clay Golem, D4. Together they teach the principles of where to hit a target where it hurts most, and just how to do it, with Jethro covering the theoretical side of things and D4 acting as a living training dummy of sorts for practical demonstrations. A cheerful man who enjoys his work, Jethro has developed quite the bond with his classroom assistant, and has taken to referring to D4 as 'David', after the phonetic spelling of his College asset ID. It's this knowledge of preventative maintenance he tries to pass on through his course- "Take care of your tools, young lot- and they'll take lives in return!"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Victor "Jigsaw" Moreau</td>
<td>Remote detonation</td>
<td> A human in his late 50's, hunched, twitching and covered in scars thanks to a few too many close encounters with his own creations. Victor has a soft Germanic accent and a simple rule when it comes to assassination: it doesn't matter how loud you are if you're not in the room when it happens. 'Listen vell, ladies and gentellmen. Ven ze general, king, queen or target of choice sits on zis cushion, ze pressure of ze bum on ze chair breaks ze sugarglass in between ze two vials, allowing ze reagents to mix. Vonce zat happens, ze fireball should consume everyzing in a twenty-foot radius, so I vould advise making a note of ze seating plan."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>Erasing</td>
<td> Bob is quiet and unassuming. You might have seen him, but your eyes probably just passed over him. He's about average height, and his hair is shortish, or maybe longer? But anyway, Bob gets rid of people. Very important people. Assassinating someone important is hard. Not the part with the dagger and the muffled scream and the look in their eyes as they come to grips with the fact that this is their last moment on the material plane. That part is easy. It's the part after, where the clerics come in and make a big show of speaking with his corpse, and the divination wizards come, all eager to curry favor with whatever poor bastard now has to sit his arse on the throne. Now there are people looking for you, and you're living out your life in a lead-lined room in some backwater safehouse. Bob doesn't teach you to assassinate people, like the others. He teaches you how to erase someone. Come dawn, no one will even wonder who used to eat the bacon and eggs the cooks are busy making or whether someone sleeps in that big bed. They'll just be gone, and you won't even have to hide, because no one is looking for you.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>William "The Raven" Finley</td>
<td>Interrogation Resistance</td>
<td> A calm old wood elf with dark brown hair, dull green skin, and hazel eyes, Silaneth sometimes spends an entire class with her nose in a book and her back turned to the students. The next day, they all receive marks. No one is quite sure for what. Some students leave in the middle of class and get a perfect score, others a failing grade for the same stunt. The joke around the academy is that it's a course in patience, not in stealth. Indeed, Sila often admonishes her students for excess haste. "If you don't know more about your mark's routine than their own family when you go in for the kill, you are making a dangerous mistake. You can learn how to clean up the murder scene from Remmings, but if the mark's head of security walks in on you because you don't know his schedule, you've got a bigger problem on your hands." Although she does teach various techniques in stealth and long distance tracking, the most useful part of her class is the weekly assignment to each student: to follow another professor in the academy, learn as much about their life as they can, and to not get caught. By the end of the course, the best students are more than capable of avoiding detection while tailing even an experienced mark. On the first day of the class, William scans the room with his deep, black eyes. Later, every student swears that his piercing gaze lingered on them just a little longer than everyone else. Everyone admits that when William looks at you, it feels like he can see directly into your soul. He was a human soldier in a special operations unit reporting directly to the highest officers in the military. A natural born leader, he did not have any profound or unique skills save that of his magnetic charisma and unyielding will. His class is well known to be grueling and unforgiving. There are no marks, only a pass or fail. Those who have passed the class, are known around the academy and either widely respected or else feared. He begins his first lecture with this, "Most of you will fail. If you have a shred of doubt in your ability to pass this class, quit now. Nine percent. That's how many of you I can expect to pass this course. Just looking around the room I can already tell which ones of you will quit within the first week." He starts pointing at the students and calling them out by name. He makes an effort to learn the names of every person in his course before they start so he can verbally abuse them from the first day. Very quickly, the students realize that during his class, he can be abusive and cruel, but is kind and friendly when not in class. He was a POW of the Drow for over a decade and sometimes recounts the sickening torture they utilized to try to get him to talk. He likes to lead groups on hikes, go camping, and tell war stories around the fire when he is not teaching. During one week of classes, towards the end of the course, students must go through hell week. This is a week of no sleep, no food, no rest. They are tortured, they are poisoned, they are bewitched. Every possible things is done to get them to give up. All they have to do is say they're done and all the pain stops. They are given a warm delicious meal in front of their peers who are still struggling. Those who don't give up, have almost passed the course. They have one final exam: to not give up a piece of information to the students of Dareth "Feelgood" Woren through a day of torture. Selected Quotes: "Your mind is your most powerful weapon and your biggest weakness. When I lived with the Monks in the mountains of Harkonell, I learned to strengthen my mind. Your assignment, from this day to the end of this course, is to meditate while in pain. Try for an hour a day. I have a list of sufficient ways to cause pain posted on my office door." "Always remember, if you're being tortured for information, that is the only thing keeping you alive. Revealing it will result in certain death. We strengthen the mind and the will because when they are weak, death will seem like a welcome reprieve." "The most powerful torture is psychological. They will tell you they're torturing your family. They will show you what may or may not be illusions of your family being tortured. They will force you to ingest poisons that cause you to forget who you are. Sometimes they will offer you something enticing instead. They might offer you riches, immunity, protection, freedom. These are all techniques to get you to break. Do not fall for them."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vulpis Dreamwine</td>
<td>Truth And Truth-Seeking</td>
<td> A sallow elf with sunken, always-wide eyes that hint at an untenable sleeplessness. Vulpis has a drunken gait, relaxed charm, and a penchant for purple in his shoddy patchwork outfit. "Get comfortable. Sometimes what you seek is just a friendly conversation away." When he's not telling stories about epic triumphs and adventures-gone-wrong, he casually chats with his students about their past, their aspirations, which classes they're taking with which professors. A Nat 20 Insight roll on one of his stories will reveal that some part of it is dishonest. On the last day of class, each student awakens to find something precious has been stolen from them. The classroom is abandoned and locked. If investigated, the school has no records of a Vulpis on staff or a "Truth And Truth-Seeking" class.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Alstair Horngrave</td>
<td>Above and Below, or How to Use Infrastructure</td>
<td> Alstair is not usually known for his manners or his appearance, however he is known for his entrances. At the beginning of each term and before any practical examinations, he makes a point of entering the room from somewhere other than the door, once even rising from the ashes in the nearby fireplace. His course mainly revolves around using sewers, rooftops, and crowded streets to disappear or approach your target unseen, taught through theory and anecdotes from his days as an urchin. On rare occasions, he'll have some of his colleagues play the role of a student as a test, blending in with their classmates for weeks at a time until that first test is deemed to be concluded. The more notable of his lessons are held outside the classroom, teaching students through real life experience in controlled environments.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>John Graves, Insurance Adjuster</td>
<td>Chaos Based Magical Assassination</td>
<td> John Graves, Insurance Adjuster, is a pillar of the community, often found helping the local priests, donating food to the poor, and helping people recover from horrific accidents that he often causes. The name, John Graves, Insurance Adjuster, is a legacy title, passed down to the highest ranked assassin in the guild (often with several "John Graves" active at a single time period, working independently). Each Graves acts slightly differently; however, they each have two things in common. They run a "respectable" business, often insurance, but another similar profession works too, such as pharmacist or banker, and Graves has made a deal with some sort of Chaos God or Great Old One, which he sells the souls of those whom sign his contracts to the chaotic one, whom eventually kills them in a chaotic accident and feeds upon the chaos surrounding their untimely death. (Chaos loves collateral damage, but the only person whom ever dies as a result of these accidents is the victim, no matter how much destruction of property or others whom are injured in the process.) Grave's weapon of choice for his assassinations is based upon a misleading contract which binds the souls of those he insures to be eventually killed in horrific accidents. Graves is able to prevent an insurance contract from causing an accidental death by burning the contract prior to the death of the signor, or instantly "activate" the contract (and cause the accidental death to occur before the next New Moon), by signing and executing the contract in his own blood. He trains new assassins by teaching them actuarial tables, and in all ways making them a perfect "drone" within his business. All initiates also sign a contract upon joining the Guild. Once an initiate has proven a perfect "Insurance Adjuster" or "Bank Teller" or otherwise, they are inducted into the secret society and given the option to become a new John Graves. If the initiate declines, the Chaos God eats the initiates soul. It is unclear how Graves monetizes his assassinations, and each Graves has independent motivations sometimes at odds with other Graves. One common tactic is to gain as many insurance contracts with high ranking members of society as he can infiltrate, and then "selling" the death to his target's enemies prior to their death.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Haber "Gasman" Devronich</td>
<td>Poisons, potions and chemistry</td>
<td> Lastman, as he is most commonly referred to, is a generally unremarkable human, and comes to each class with a fresh costume, set of mannerisms and name. He never tells new students this, and one of the earliest 'grades' given is how long it takes to figure out that all the teachers they've had are the same person. A tall, bulky half-orc, Shaav wears armor almost constantly, and will challenge individual students to duels if they slight him. He is surprisingly eloquent, and knows almost every book of sword theory front and back. He has never actually worked as an assassin, but quickly teaches his students that no fight will ever be between them and a similarly-sized individual. A tall, imposing elf, Devronich is covered in centuries of burns, scars and boils, and always wears an asbestos hazard suit for protection while in class, and more than once he has accidentally incapacitated his entire class. He constantly coughs and giggles to himself, and those who are in his classes rarely stay for more than a semester, and few have survived more than two.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kethan Quentith</td>
<td>Applied Anatomy</td>
<td> A scholarly Drow man with round glasses and tousled white hair, generally absent minded and gregarious but keenly focused when it comes to surgeries, dissections, and other less reputable applications of his craft (torture foremost amongst them). He left the Underdark not because of some innate goodness but because he wanted to work on greater varieties of species than could be found below the surface. Students under him learn how the bodies of most common races are put together and, consequently, how to take them apart in excruciating or efficient ways</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The silent council</td>
<td>stealth and distraction</td>
<td> A tribe of feral kenku who use their mimicry and movements to teach their pupils the art of moving silently, knowing when to speak and not, causing distractions, and finding the opportune time to strike. They are highly intelligent but seem to care not for material things beyond their robes and daggers, though they do accept offerings of food in exchange for a chance to be taught a lesson in their art. The selection methods of the council are unknown. Some say they have the ability to shape change into monstrous forms of feather and shadow - known silent council students will not speak of this.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Supremely Eminent Hobgoblin Cancer-Kill Educator VI, Whose Wisdom Mustn't Be Questioned</td>
<td>Hobgob Campus V: The Very Best Campus on the Planet or in the Sky if the Sky Had Campuses</td>
<td> This otherwise unblemished, jovial hobgoblin is stooped under the weight of an eyewateringly disgusting hump on his back that pulses in the middle of class. If he catches you staring he pulls his robe a little to show you more. He's very proud of his hump. He extracts all his best diseases from it. SEHC-KE4WWMBQ teaches the uniquely hobgoblinoid assassination tool of natural causes. Hobgoblins mercilessly execute any who use the sacred arts of battle to kill dishonorably. And since the only acceptable ways for a hobgoblin to die are in battle or of disease, hobgob assassins need to get creative. And they don't use poison. This isn't poison and if you suggest it is to SEHC-KE4WWMBQ he will have you thrown out of his class immediately. This is natural causes. In SEHC-KE4WWMBQ's putrid study hall you will learn about Slough Rot, the Masonry-disease of the Gibbering Mouther, and how to spread it from floor to man. You will be taught how to culture the Love-cancer, which metastasizes in your nose and spreads by kiss. You will learn the 50 ways to kill a man by leaving a moldy piece of toast under his sink. You will, Hobgob willing, grow your own garden of throwing viruses, whose protein capsids grow so long and sharp that they can be used as daggers. Due to a quirk in the hobgoblin code that last one still technically counts as kosher.</td>

<td>Val Raveneyes</td>
<td>Political and disguises</td>
<td> A freshly groomed bearded human man. Wearing noble's clothing. Mastermind Rogue and Warlock levels a Raven sits on his shoulder when he rests. He is extremely blunt and prides himself on efficiency. Silver tongued through years of being a fence in a thieves guild, he has surpassed his teachers. Able to craft any disguise in hours, he has even disguised others to appear as him while he sat in on his own class to show how effective it is. "Remember that saying? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?" "Disguise yourself and your enemies think you friend, making it all the easier. Poison and a sharp blade can do the rest." "Blue blood is as good as red blood. Ribs 5 and 6, dagger goes between those for best results."</td>

<td>Phalin Ghandos</td>
<td>Information with Style</td>
<td> This happy-go-lucky half-elf plays everywhere, palaces, inns, taverns, and even town squares. While he's laughing with nobles, he's bedding the help. All the while gathering information for weak spots either in security or in court. Trained at the College of Swords, Phalin is as deadly with a blade as is his wit. Oh and to pass his class you've got to gain information he doesn't already have.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sergeant Cutler</td>
<td>Military Etiquette</td>
<td> A grizzled human male, Cutler looks out of place in his worn mail shirt among the black-clad faculty. A veteran of many foreign militaries, militias, mercenaries, posses, gangs, city watches and similarly regimented organizations, Cutler's lessons can let any soft-handed assassin-to-be swagger into a barracks without a second glance from its occupants. A few brave souls refer to him behind his back as "The Seamstress" for his talent at repairing and imitating any uniform, a lesson he teaches under the moniker of "Advanced Military Infiltration."</td>

<td>Vrok Grathul</td>
<td>Assassination for Haruspicy</td>
<td> Vrok is an elderly orc with bone piercings across his face and arms. He speaks slowly and uses few words, but is not unintelligent. He teaches a method of knifework that assassinates the target but preserves the entrails in the best possible state for divination.

Sometimes less than savory folk has less than savory needs for bodies. Breathing or otherwise. A gang may need a corpse to serve as a body double, a rich vampire may want a meal and doesn't feel like hunting it themselves, or a demonic cult may need specific body parts for their dark rituals. Whether the client will pay on delivery of a corpse, a living captive, or a just pint of blood, it doesnt make much difference. The victim dies sooner or later, and you'll learn to be paid either way.</td>

He continued towards the desk, his fine clothes formed a snug fit over his slender body, barely wrinkling at all as he moved. The most striking thing however were his unusually sharp features, aquiline nose, combed back hair, and seeming use of dark makeup to enhance the already prominent amber eyes, leaving him looking about as hawk-like as human can be, and a less wise man might even mistake him for a hengeyokai of that variety. There had been less wise men, but nobody believed them, after all they had all shown to be fools, scoundrels or both. The first one ended up on the streets after utterly ruining his merchant family's legacy. The second was nothing but a lowly thief and hung for his crimes. The third, he died to his brothers rapier, a befitting end for seducing the poor brothers wife. He had taken no pleasure in their deaths, why would he? He wasn't a monster, no; but seeing the hope in their eyes fade and be replaced with panic as their whole world collapsed around them, that, that was what made him feel alive, so there he stood in front of the class ready to pass on his skills to a new generation, his mouth forming a small smile as he spoke in the voice of someone knowing they own the world, "Class is now in session".</td>

Whilst she is all charm and graces when on a job, as a teacher she is exacting and methodical. She teaches her students how to goad their marks into their own downfalls, with weddings and wagers being her forte. Where time and planning is available, she can take a mark and have them under her thumb within a short few months; Marriage proposal to the aisle in under 6. Before the year is out she is a tragic widow with a dazed look in her eyes and many people falling over themselves to console her until she disappears to ‘recover’. Where she is short on time she has been known to use pride and folly to her advantage, convincing the unsuspecting into ill-advised bets that lead to their demise. Whether it’s to protect her honour, to impress her, or simply her gentle coaxing into a bad decision already waiting to happen, Lady Haverly has seen many a mark fall to their death on the duelling crowd, attempting impossible feats or simply falling into debt so heavy that taking their own lives seems the sensible option. Lady Vivica lives by the principle of why get your hands dirty if they’ll do it themselves for you?</td>

A successful student of her's will be able to turn an otherwise upstanding citizen into their own unwilling lackey or a social pariah fit only to be run out of town. She also insists on all of her students drinking heavily during her classes to build up their tolerance, "You should always be prepared to drink your mark under the table."   Lockjaw is a no-nonsense goblin with a knack for remembering every face she sees. An accomplished networker and fence, she is as dangerous at a negotiating table as she is with a blade. Most any person is to have some personal items on them, usually in the form of jewelry, magical items, or heirlooms. While in some cases it is important to leave these identifying items on a corpse, you are more likely to live to see your next contract if the authorities have to ask who is dead before they can as why they are dead. You could destroy these items, but that would be a shameful waste. Better to sell them to someone who understands the importance of discretion. Prof. O'Mally is a fence first and an assassin second. Her class is devoted to safely and secretly selling the goods of the recently deceased. She also teaches courses in negotiating contracts and sizing up potential employers to determine who is and is not safe to work with.   A tall, pale human who has clearly spent too much time in dark places, Forlom clearly emphasizes magical acumen first, meditation second, and hygiene last.

He will set up traps days in advance, knowing exactly where and when his mark will be vulnerable. Graduates of his plan their strike days in advance, set their traps, and leave with enough time to be miles away before the hit takes place. There is no need to witness the kill in person when you can witness it magically.</td>

He speaks quickly with a slightly high pitched voice and a tendency to go off on rambling esoteric tangents. Vain and sesquipedalian, he has little time and less interest in those who are beneath him intellectually. Quick to anger and defensive when challenged, he nonetheless is a skilled instructor for competent students. He specializes in obscure and undetectable poisons and deadly agents. Example lecture: "Hello class" "Today we are going to be discussing the use of hormonally triggered toxins. Those of you who bothered to attend our last lab section... "Will recall the value of decoupling cause and effect in a discrete assassination. A quality investigator will firstly attempt to link the motive, opportunity and action to the effect. The effect of course is the inhumation of the relevant target. By decoupling the apparent cause and effect we can disguise our connection, hence the value of asymptomatic pathological agents that are triggered by means at a far remove from our own actions. "The classice example is what is crudely known as the "Lecher's trap" which you will find an in depth discussion of in Chapter 6 of Mironnel Krenski's text "Obscure toxicological agents and Other Discrete Political Agents" available at the university library. This is a sample of purpose bred sporulated Entamoeba histolytica. It is an anaerobic parasitic that may infect any known humanoid. This particular strain has been bred to enter the vascular tissue of any higher vertebrate. After amebiatic introduction, it takes 1-2 days to colonize and passively wait for the proper hormonal trigger. It may persist in its vegetative metabolic condition for at least 2 years. "This is the extract of Hyoscyamus of the genus Solanaceae. When administered to a person results in a increased production of glucocorticoids over for approximately a week. "Weren't you listening?!?! This vial is harmless!!! Our whole purpose is carrying two discrete agents that can trigger a deadly effect!!!!!" "The increased production of glucocorticoids can be noted in the affected creatures saliva and other mucosal secretions!!!! This glucocorticoid will trigger the amoebic agent and result in the rapid death secondary to uncontrolled bleeding over the course of 2-3 days approximately 1 week after the combination of these agents! Meaning we can infect a target and later place the trigger in a person who will shortly have intimate contact with our target allowing us sufficient time to absent ourselves and introduce reasonable doubt into the actual moment of poisoning!"</td>

Despite being a dark elf, Velkan appears to be one of the most civilized, well-spoken, and hygienic people one could know. However, during practical training exercises, Velkan adopts an entirely new personality. He becomes manic and highly elusive, covering himself in dirt, mud, foliage, and any miscellaneous objects to assist him in blending in to his surroundings. His dark skin serves as a natural aid when stalking in the shadows and, in combination with his silent movements, becomes almost impossible to locate when he wishes to remain hidden. Students and faculty report Velkan sometimes "appearing out of thin air, as if coming out of an invisibility spell." He will frequently stalk students and staff alike when he's in one of his moods. There are rumors that he startled the head apothecary by perfectly disguising as the intricate wallpaper that covered the head apothecary's study.

That first impression would be correct. Kerlead is loud, bombastic, brazen, and can take out an entire guard barracks with a single spark. Kerlead's specialty lies in explosives and artillery, but is highly knowledgeable about most other heavy weapons. When stealth is not a feasible option, the constantly drunken dwarf's ideology is to "level the playing field." Literally. With high explosives. His nickname, "Big-Splash", actually has more than one meaning. While he is highly efficient with area-of-effect weaponry, he is also infamous with the other instructors for spilling full mugs of beer when he is drinking, and he drinks often without regard for who is around him as well as without fear of reprisal for showing up to lecture, intoxicated, with full mugs in each hand. During his class, students will learn mostly technical information about various explosives, artillery pieces, fuses, and trigger mechanisms. Information includes kill radius of explosives, simple ballistic maths, ammunition types and uses for artillery pieces, and speeds at which different fuses burn in different weather conditions. The culminating event of the class is to make and implement their own chain-explosive devices, which must consist of at least 5 individual bombs linked together and all detonated via a single slow-burning fuse.</td>

It starts, funnily enough, by making your Target very happy using a variety of tinctures and potions brewed specifically to lift the spirits. After a week or two of these raised spirits, life begins to take a turn for the worse for our Target. As you cut off their supply of joy, a beloved pet may die, a confidant may betray them, they may be mocked in the public eye, and they will find themselves isolated. A potion to dull the senses, but not the mind will make the quiet comforts of the Target's life do anything but.

Then students are split into groups and made to run a tavern, each assigned a patron to learn about. Finally, the most promising students are sent on missions of an economic variety - which he gets a percentage of, of course. In his class you will learn how to acquire items needed for any mission. You will learn to bargain, trade, deal and swindle. Buy the loyalty of the targets' guards. Corner the market in their secret desires and force them to come to you. Once you have their trust, you ruin them. Take their house, income, servants and leave them with nothing.

Aside from his famously mellow demeanor, however, he has one other trait students remember him for: an alarming tendency to forget just how much stronger he is than everyone else.

Sometimes when your target is too high profile to be able to dispose of it on the more classic methods, so it's just more expedient to, ahem, "convince" them that it's on their best interests to skip town, or to step down from their public position. Whether it is a blattant lie or an elegant knot of truths, Granny Nightdale has toppled Kings and Emperors by getting the right information to the wrong ears.

Thurl specializes in legal assassinations. He hunts his marks not through the streets at night, but through the courtrooms and temples of justice. Should you find yourself his target, the guards will be tipped off about every crime you have ever committed, the judges will be aware of every character foible you posses, and the executioner will be aware of what you did to his daughter. The hands of justice will turn against you. Or, if he cannot find sufficient evidence, you will find yourself in a string of profitable deals, quickly climbing he ladders of wealth and society until suddenly one deal goes sour, and a merchant believes you have cheated him. Once that happens, he tells his friends, end every contract is re-reviewed. They'll find that the ore you supplied was sub-par, the wine was vinegar and water, the coins you paid were clipped.

Marcus Fletcher, having been the bottom of his class and having fought tooth and nail to his current status, learned the lessons he teaches the hardest way possible.

She is always saying that "The best assassin is the one they least expect, and nobody even notices an old lady with a face like a wrinkled apple." She has perfected her grandmotherly appearance and down-home appeal and encourages each assassin to find their "mundane persona" to extend into the world when being a polished assassin would stick out. She also recommends ways to hide your strength, for example, where with the Babushka you would see a rotund older dwarf woman bent with age, hauling some sticks, you do not process that her fat is actually entirely muscle, and her sticks are bristling with her swords. It is certainly jarring to see her demonstrations in class, where, in mere moments, she goes from hobbling about to a blurred whirlwind of blades and then back again.</td>

<td>Rickert Oswald</td>
<td>Leaving a Mark</td>
<td> Rickert is a tan skinned human, wrinkles just starting to line his face and the color fading from his hair. This isn't uncommon with assassination instructors, as typically one doesn't become a teacher until they have retired. He teaches an art so often forgotten in a profession typically about covering up the messes they make, which is how to make an assassination look as grisly as possible. Clients who want their enemies to know they mean business seek him and his style out, as the body is found with marks of torture, or displayed in ways that invoke true horror. His most famous tale is a political assassination where he had managed to cook and prepare all the organs of his victim and lay them out at his estate for a dining party to find mere hours later. He enjoys telling this story as his class is eating lunch for the day, as he greatly enjoys the reactions. "You don't need to make anyone suffer. As long as the remains make it look like they did, no one will even want to know the details."</td>

<td>Gorg Aselif</td>
<td>From Sewers to Skylines: Blending in and getting out in all occasions</td>
<td> While there are many classes and ways to learn to get in and out of a kill, Gorg's class is one of the few that teaches you how to get from the sewer at noon, into the fancy ball before nightfall, and out the front gate a little past midnight while looking and smelling like you were invited. His tactics use previously learned material, such as moving through sewers and climbing buildings, and mixing in new methods such as stashing clothes and planting false evidence. The course also teaches other diversions, when to keep a low or high profile during an event, and how to properly judge the distance from a rooftop to the ground and tends to attract students that are less suited for an actual fight and more equipped to stir up a panic and leave. Gorg is a gnome with a varied past, supposedly raised by goblins and trained by noblemen, he teaches most lessons in the field, meaning in the sewers or on a roof, and often gets the class to go to royal balls, for free of course.</td>

<td>In Plain Sight - The Fine Art and Etiquette of Honorable Murder</td>
<td> "The way to a man's heart, they say, is through his stomach. But if you want to reach his brain, I recommend the eye socket." The mechanism of the honor duel exists in nearly all cultures, and the daring assassin may bend it to his will to kill his target publicly, decisively, and (most importantly) legally. Quintius, once the Count of Imperia, is a master of this technique, which involves drawing the target into an honor duel through social maneuvering. And, of course, winning the duel. He presents himself as a squat little pudding of a human with a ruddy complexion and drooping eyes, which he later reveals is part of the game. "The target must see you not as a predator, but as prey. Draw them in, then, like the viper, strike. The involvement of disguises, aliases, and poisons where necessary are recommended, and the establishment of a reputation is the death of this art."</td>

He has a very fine collection of old spellbooks. When - gods forbid - a fellow professor passes away, he has a very hard time holding back his urge to ransack the dead person's room. He has one book in his collection that he never shows anyone - the Black Grimoire of the Necromancer Tsyesende. It was thought lost, and he fears for his life if anyone should find out he has it.

However, many students report that outside of class, the dwarf makes a great advisor, for life and drink, and is an incredible arm wrestler. Once per term, the dwarf gives any student the chance to defeat him in an arm wrestling match in exchange for perfect marks on an examination. No student has ever conquered this challenge yet.</td>

<td>Wingle Grimblesnout</td>
<td>Professor of Olfaction</td>
<td> Professor Grimblesnout could easily be mistaken for a dwarf or a gnome simply due to his incredibly small stature, and the fact that he is so bent over that his head is level with his chest. Having been in a family of alchymists he was introduced to the craft at a young age. He always had an impeccable sense of smell, and no one quite knew why. The reason behind this is that he was infected with Lycantrhpy Rota when he was a child. In the laymans terms, he is a rat lycan. Grimblesnout has quite the passion for smell. making sure that his students know the importance of knowing every regent in your laboratory by smell, he really revels in particular odours, some of them delightful, some of them less so. He is especially fascinated by powerful smells, whether it is the delightful aroma of an effervescent love potion. Or the overbowering stench of a troglodyte. Smells just fascinate him. He tends to forget that having Troglodyte extract shoved up your nose, doesn't really excite the students as much as it excites himself, and of course anyone lucky enough to be out of noseshot. Don't ask him what Olfaction is. In his eyes, the science of smell, is the groundwork to every other important science.</td>

<td> None but the headmistress know how a lowly kobold managed to secure a position as a professor at the university, but here he stands, nonetheless. Ved is rather tall for a kobold, standing just over 3 feet in height, and is quite excitable. It is clear to any who take his classes that the kobold is passionate about his field, and from the testimony of those who have taken any of the scaly professor's classes, Ved is a surprisingly enjoyable teacher, who is genuinely invested in his students' works. While he isn't the most intelligent person in the world, he makes up for it with immense creativity and unwavering determination. Still, creativity and determination alone doesn't prevent the poor kobold from becoming the unfortunate victim of nearly all of the jerry-rigged traps he shows as an example to the class. Ved, along with a small following of his former students, were able to found a new department (which Ved personally named and is immensely proud of), with the headmistress's approval, in order to better inform future adventurers and dungeon-crafters alike about the intricacies of trap design.</td>

Until then, he seeks out visionaries and converts, and writes down every decision the head of his order makes, all in a hope of finding a unified dogma.

It was only when he rediscovered his childhood dream of interacting with great, exotic beasts- and found he could, in his own way, bring them to life- that his love for his work was rekindled. He's currently attempting to create a complete set of parchment cards that will allow the animals to interact with each other- although once he's completed it, who knows what he'll do with it, and the tedium of academia will no doubt come crawling into his life again.

This firebolg stands near 8 feet tall and usually carries with him at least one book for either pleasure reading, research, or class. New students fear him until they take his class however, then they understand he is a soft spoken, kindly individual. He understands that not all students have vast interest in the world of magical plants and their many beneficial properties but he never the less expects his students to try. His office equally suited for him. No desk, just several large bookshelves, a fire place and several squashy armchairs. Students who choose to come to his office hours can expect to be stuck in a lengthy chat for upwards of an hour for a simple question. His passion and appreciation for his subject is endless and he hopes to instill that in his students. As a result his students tend to try harder in his class, less out of interest in the class but more out of appreciation for the professor.</td>

The young human is as often found sitting in on council meetings to advise on civil unrest issues as he is charming students in his lecture theatre: his foppish mop of brown hair, dazzling grin and red velvet waistcoat seem tailored to the latter, however. Flamboyant appearance aside, the Professor is an inspiring man, delivering impassioned speeches fluently in any of the five languages of Novo Kharkus. If anyone were to meticulously trace the sacks of gold allocated to Lutraine's field work, however, they would find substantial amounts in the hands of Dwarven militants and High Elven supremacists alike.

He doesn't think he deserves the position, but he doesn't want to embarrass his friend, so he just does his best. Though, at least the students love him, and his underlings do their best to cover for their beloved dean.</td>

If you get him talking, you'll be hard pressed to get him to stop talking, as he wanders from subject to subject to off-kilter tangent. It is a moderately well kept secret that Tryskin is working on a cloning program to allow certain individuals of wealth and power to survive in a new body, if they should suffer an accident with their old one. It is a secret known only to the clone masquerading as Tryskin that the real Tryskin has been on vacation for the past seven months. The clone is getting worried, since Tryskin really should have been back by now.</td>

If everyone would just leave her alone to her studies everyone would be much better off. Her colleagues have taken to borrow scrolls and books from her extensive collection to answer questions for inquiring souls, rather than subject them to her acerbic personality.</td>

He doesn't have any particular love for the subject, but he has learned a lot about it by necessity, and has found that the career as a professor is less dangerous than his previous one. He does need to stop filling half his class room time with anecdotes, if he wants to keep the position.</td>

<td> Professor Hornsby is a typical dottering academic who loves to dig through ancient ruins to unearth ancient artifacts. He specializes in ancient writing, especially arcane runes, scrolls, and diagrams for lost magical constructs. Although he loves digging through ruins, he is rarely prepared for the dangers of what has since taken up residence, having no adventuring experience. His studies have taught him to cast up to third level spells, but he mostly prepares spells to help in his studies more than in combat, like Gust of Wind to clear sand from a ruined tablet.</td>

Longor Onestorm, Captain to his students, The Hammers of Windspire to many songs and scrolls, has never lost his great courage, or his mirthful spirit. Great physical strength borne of a hard-scrabble childhood, the man is broad and tall. Having spent many years at war, he has lost much and yet he is always genial and full of hopeful optimism. Those he prepares for battle take away much more than skill in the art of melee. They learn from Longor the value in seeing each enemy as more than a monster, in imagining him complexly and understanding that his conviction is as great as their own. And, in the end, having the courage still to kill him in service to the cause; this, Longor holds, is true nobility.</td>

He is middle aged for a kobold and often shows disdain towards the larger races while assisting the smaller folk who take his classes. Kroggar treads a close line as he has been brought up to the university board a number times for down marking the taller of the humans and elves that take his class and passing failing shorter students.</td>

<td>Zachariah MacRuaidri</td>
<td>Professor of Demonology and Abyssal Linguistics</td>
<td> Narrow-build and towering over most of his students and fellow professors, Xanthras is an individual of very few words and even fewer public appearances. When he does interact with others, the albino speaks his mind and with only the bare-bones of syntactical structure to get his point across as quick and simple as possible. When he doesn't teach his admittedly quite small courses on psyionics, he keeps to the university archives and tends to the tens of thousands of books with almost feverish tenacity and fanatic devotion - often not so subtly threatening painful, sometimes even lethal consequences to any fool who might damage one of the precious scrolls or almanacs. Most of the student body, and quite a few of his colleagues are relieved that he mostly keeps to the library. After all, even to the most seasoned of adventurers and arcanists, an honest to the gods Illithid can and will invoke a feeling of unsettling dread - even if he wears a professor's robes. With his fiery hair, sunken-in green eyes, pointed nose and lanky stature, Zachariah resembles more a crazed, animated scarecrow than a regular human being, and is known for his snide, with colloquialism and broad accent-riddled remarks and the sheer limitless supply of whiskey he is somehow able to pull from the insides of his coat. It is universally agreed on that the only reason he has not been kicked out of the university yet, is the fact that 1) despite his eccentrism and occasional spouts of jackassery, he is a very dedicated and capable teacher, 2) he possesses vast and intricate knowledge of the Abyss and its inhabitants, no doubt related to the warlock's fiendish patron, and 3) he proved himself to be absolutely willing to put an accidentally released glabrezu in a headlock if it meant protecting his students.</td>

Tardiness is not tolerated except in the case of major injury, malady, or magical mishap. Her exam practicums also had a reputation for being exceedingly difficult. Even as headmistress, she continues to tolerate no shenanigans from students, and only barely from certain faculty members. The root of this sternness is her omnipresent no-nonsense seriousness. Normally this would be intimidating, but Octavia's possibly subconscious penchant for theatrics makes it quite comical.

He is cagey and gleeful in his ferocity and he has a deep and impassioned reverence for primal rage, an emotion that he believes to be the only authentic thing a true warrior can feel in battle. While those raised in barbarian tribes either do not take to contemplative endeavors, or follow those endeavors far and away from the barbaric battle arts, Kraddic Cobbhearth embraced and enjoined the two. A professor keen on active praxis over hollow pontificating, his classroom is in the field. He is glad for his tenure as a professor, and has great respect for those students who veer from the traditional barbarian path into his class and into the underexplored study of barbaric philosophy. You can see him most days in the yard, his bald head bobbing and weaving around training weapons, and his great copper mustache, reaching to his knees and bedecked in gems and rings and bones, swaying as he deftly moves. Many years of deeply philosophical self-reflection has given Kraddic a level of emotional control uncommon among barbarians, fortunately for his students as his prowess in battle is surpassed only by a very few great dwarves and orcs of legend.</td>

For her dissertation, Jhoira "gave life" to several humanoid constructs that now inhabit the town around the academy and pioneered the field of alchemical artifice. Her life revolves around academia and has an almost visceral distaste for small-talk.

And, a faerie village can serve as a hub for NPCs, plot hooks, and small-scale supplies in regions of the world that is largely devoid of civilization.

<td>Flaherty</td>
<td>Male Dryad Minor Noble</td>
<td> A minor noble in the Seelie Court and the brother of Jirvel. He leads a live of luxury in the giant oak in the middle of the glade he calls his domain. This glade is about one acre in size and can only be reached during the twilight hours before dusk and left during the twilight hours after dawn. If somebody gets trapped in the glade by not leaving before sunrise, he offers to let them stay the day in his oak, in exchange for a small favour in the future. If the person agrees this is a binding magical contract that can only be lifted by both parties agreeing to lift it. Other fey generally recognise his claim on the glade and the minor fey living in it adress him as Lord of the Glade and pay tribute to him in the form of minor gifts, which allows him to live his livestlye. In return he takes his promise to protect the glade and all that live in it very seriously. The only thing that means more to Flaherty then the glade and it's inhabitants is his younger sister Jirvel. She is his shining star, his rising sun, his scarlet poppy, something he is very eager to everybody that would listen. He has in fact been spending the last few years looking for a fitting husband, but in his eyes nobody is good enough for his darling sister. You can imagine his suprise when his sister returned from one of her trips in the company of a 1000 years old oak that one of her druid friends had cast awaken on and declared him her fiance. Flaherty, at first reluctant, has by now warmed up to the idea and has been busy with the preparations for the wedding. He has spared no expenses and even called in a lot of favours for this occasion, nothing is too good his sisters wedding. Because of this the wedding will be the most lavish and extravagant thing the forrest has ever seen (flowers from all over the world both as decoration and food for the smaller fey, will-o-wisps captured and stuffed into lantern that float through the air, a satyr band, a fountain of the best wine), and there will be a lot of different guests that traveled from long and far to attend the wedding. (Not only fey, but hags, human nobles, gnomish sages, sentient animals, even some elementals and minor celestials, but anybody is welcome really) If the players arive at the glave it is actually the night of the wedding and they can see the lights and hear the music from anywhere on the glade. Secrets: The giant oak he lives in is actually his bound tree and not only that but it is actually a treant that he merged with centuries ago. They share one mind and if somebody or something threatens the glade the two will merge and the oak will rise and defend it. While merged the two count as one creature, use the Treant statblock, but with a dryads metal stats, skills, innate spellcasting and magic resistance. During the wedding of his sister Flaherty is actually unable to decline any one favour asked of him by one of the guests, provided they brought a present for the bride. This fact is not a secret, but Flaherty doesn't share it willingly with anybody uninitiated. The players might learn of this from one of the other guests, including Jirvel. There is a bit more to his love for his sister then he would ever be willing to puplicly admit. He knows that this is wrong and it gnaws on his mind. He is hoping that once his sister is married he will be able to forget about these feeling, an empty hope.</td>

<td>Jirvel</td>
<td>Female Dryad Minor Noble</td>
<td> The Bride. Sister of Flaherty. While technically a noble of the Seelie Court, she is not yet seen as a proper member since she hasn't bounded yet. This fact means that she is still mortal, still ages, still bleeds, something she wants to change as soon as possible. She knew that her brother could never decide on a husband for her, so she decided to take things into her own hands. She has been using her influence over the forrests animals to search for a fitting husband. While she doesn't have a strong realm like her brother has the fact that she is not yet bonded means she is free to go whereever she pleases and as a result of that her net of favours, while not as strong actually extends even far outside the boundary of their native forrest. Her favorite tools are the birds, because they are the most free of creatures. This is how she learned about an ancient oak, many days travel outside her brothers sphere of influence. An oak so old that nobody she questioned could actually tell her how long it had been around. So she went to Freija, a young female human druid from the nearby village. And they went to seek out this oak and when they found it Freija awakened the old tree. After Freija cast her spell, the tree slowly started to stir and rise, look around, then take notice of the tiny creatures in front of him that had just given him sentience. When asked what his name was, he pondered for what Jirvel experienced to be an excrutiatingly annoying amount of time until finally telling them his name: Greagoir It took forever to get the slow giant back to the glade, especially since the daft fool would allways stop and look onto the most mundane things with amazement. When they finally arived at the glade she imediatly told her brother that she planned to marry the tree. He was at first against it, like she knew he would be, but she also knew that in the end he wouldn't deny her any request. Especially since he knows just how valuable a catch her husband was. And now only the wedding itself stands between her and finally bonding with her husband and becomming a fully fledged and very powerfull dryad. Secrets: Look at Freija's NPC block to find out the story of the two. Jirvel is actually very aware of the true nature of her brothers feeling for her. She doesn't feel the same in any way, she in fact despises him, for beeing so much older and more influential. In her mind, she should have been the one born first and the glade should have been hers. But she knows how to hide her feelings and knows how to use Flaherty's feeling to her advantage. Right now her brother is the most powerfull ally she has, but this might change soon. Her true ambitions are to be much more powerfull then her brother, to become to him as overpowering a presence as he had been to her all these years. She aims to shed the shackles of beeing only a "minor" noble, she would become a proper one, somebody that at the mere metion of her name would make all the other fey tremble both in awe and fear at the same time. Her brother might be content with beeing the Lord of the Glade, but she would be the Lady of the whole forrest. The Lady of the Woods, only that would be a proper titel for her. And this marriage is the next big step in achieving this goal.</td>

<td>Freija</td>
<td>Female Human Druid</td>
<td> (I originally had this as part of Jirvel, but it really disrupted the flow of the narative, so I put it here because it is still important for the personality of Jirvel) If you asked Freija what the relationship between the two of them was, she would tell you that Jirvel was something like her fairy godmotherto her. If you asked Jirvel, she would tell you that she owns the girl. A few years back, when Freija was still a young girl learning the druidic ways from their village elder, she fell in love with a local boy called Myca. But Myca was older, his father was the local butcher, so he was quite well of. No way he would fall for the weird local tree girl. But then like in the fairy tails, a beautiful woman apeared to her in the woods and offered her. She knew so much, about how she was in love, how she could get closer to Myca, what to talk with him about to get him to like her. And with her help she managed to win the love of her live. She is now married to Myca, she is the local druid after the elder died and he is a hunter. They have a little daughter aged 3 and a little boy aged 1. She is very gratefull to her fairy godmother and would do anything for her. Jirvel first learned of the girl from one of her spies, the foolish child had actually been talking to the birds about her feelings. She had first gone to her village on a whim, feeling bored she had toyed with the idea of breaking the girls dreams, maybe take the boy away if he was really as handsome as the girl was saying. But when she laid eyes upon the girl she imediatley felt the potential she had to become a powerfull druid, and she had actually allready even found a mentor to guide her. So she made a plan, to take control over this girl, to aquire her while she was still young and dumb and easy to influence. First she charmed the boy, he wasn't really good looking, more like handsome but in a very common way. And once she had the boy devoted to her (an easy task, he was a teenage boy after all), she told him that if wanted to continue their relationship he would have to court this girl for her. She then went to the girl, told her what to do, what to say. In truth nothing the girl could have said, would have stopped the boy, she could have been a pig and he still would have done as Jirvel told him. And so the years passed and the girls power grew, when the girls mentor started to slow down her growth she got rid of him, and the girl grew to be much more powerfull then he had ever been. The boy grew too, when he was told to marry her he did so, when he was told to give her a child he did so, and every time he went out to hunt he would come to seek her out. She had no real desire to be with the boy, but she enjoyed the thought of his wife at home, with her children waiting for her beloved husband to return, while we lay with her amoung the leaves. The girls whole life, dancing as a pawn in the palm of her hand. And now that the girl had fullfilled her purpose she was still a powerfull pawn, but a disposable one. Jirvel very much looks forward to one day telling the girl everything and seeing her whole world crumble.</td>

A few of his own gardening tools are quite magical. He acts kind to those that enter his shop casually, but when someone that has a great need for something enters his shop he will do whatever he can to trade them what they want at the cost of something they have great sentimental value in. He can be very mischievous, and even taunting to those that have traded something to him that the once greatly adored, and will not easily trade it back to them.</td>

<td>Male Ogre Geomancer</td>
<td> A large ogre with dark grey skin, and piercing green eyes and a set of spectacles. He speaks very intelligently, but has issues with using profanity often. He wears a dense, grey, woolen shirt, and tan overalls. He works in mines to prevent their collapse, and to locate the ore or gemstones in them. Often he uses his own strength to amend issues in the construction of a mine. He respects the earth and stone of the mines he works in, and can speak to it in a way to find the best way to reinforce it.</td>

<td>Bartholomew the Great and Powerful, First of His Name, Whose Arts Rattle the Vaults of Heaven</td>
<td>Male Half-elf Charlatan</td>
<td> Bartholomew (or, to his friends and/or paramours, Tol) is a lanky, somewhat frazzled half-elf with a shock of red hair. 'Shock' is an appropriate word; this stage magician uses what small sorcerous talents he has to swindle away the money of every backwoods family and small-town bumpkin from here to the Whitespire Mountains. Make no mistake, though: he might be terrible at performing magic, but he is a prodigy at summoning the eldritch horrors and assorted unsavory creatures that slaughter any who would turn him in to the authorities.</td>

<td>Who are these demonologists, shadowhunters, crusaders, and exorcists?</td>
<td>The old priest winks, drains his cup of wine, and spryly hops off his bar stool. "Come on," he smiles, "if we go now, I can get you in and out of the temple's crypt before the midnight devotions begin."</td>
<td> Last week, we made some fiendish villains, so it seems fitting that we collect some NPCs who oppose such beings. These NPCs could run the gamut from eager allies to dangerous foils, but they should not be sinister on all accounts (to distinguish them from villains). The NPCs don't have to be developed deeply, but they should have enough suggested content that any DM could quickly fill in what's missing. I'll post a few examples.</td>

<td>Brother Calymus</td>
<td>Male Human Scholar</td>
<td> A priest of the First Order of the Light, Brother Calymus is a spry, balding old man who's been wandering the world for half a century, seeking out ghosts, survivor's of near-death experiences, and other strange phenomenon attributed to the Spirit Realm. He's written two popular books on the topic and is happy to talk at length about the mysteries of death, especially over a cup of strong red wine. Whenever you run into Brother Calymus in a tavern or brothel, he's bound to know where some dark presence is lurking nearby in the world (and likely, he's eager to investigate once he finds the right help).</td>

<td>Sir Harrisen Figg</td>
<td>Male Human Knight</td>
<td> Tall and handsome with long dark hair and neatly-trimmed mustaches, Sir Harrisen was the heir of House Figg, but after the strange circumstances of the death of his sister, he renounced his inheritance and left his family to join the Watcher's Swords, pledging his life to hunting down enemies of the Moon Maiden's church. Figg has been particularly prolific in seeking out and destroying demons who reveal themselves in the world. He carries an ancestral sword that had been called Greatknife which he has renamed Fiendbane. When you meet him, you'll find he's a bit stiff, but he means well.</td>

<td>Sister Dierdre</td>
<td>Female Human Priestess</td>
<td> Sister Dierdre's wide green eyes smile, despite a sadness lingering about her young face. She often fiddles with her long blonde braid when she speaks, especially if asked about her past. Dierdre was the promiscuous daughter of a high-ranking soldier, who couldn't seem to keep herself out of trouble, so her father sent her away to join the Second Order of the Light. She always approached ghosts and demons with fascination and, of late, has discovered her own talent as a medium between the world and the Spirit Realm.</td>

<td> Clad in mail and leather, Lady Joenna Longfisk is a tall maid with short-cropped auburn hair. She took up the sword against her father's wishes, following her young liege lord to battle in his fateful campaign against the Ice Clans. The campaign was largely successful, save the death of her liege lord. Too proud to return home, Lady Joenna pledged her sword in the service of the Storm King's Temple of Winter. Never at home among the men of the temple guard, a powerful priestess who had befriended her sent Lady Joenna back among the lands of the Ice Clans to search for an ancient shrine to the Storm King that's been lost for centuries.</td>

<td>Goodson Harbert</td>
<td>Male Human Exorcist</td>
<td> With a missing eye and a wooden leg, Goodson Harbert cuts an intimidating figure, especially for a priest. He reeks of booze and speaks in a growl, but he's a warm soul beneath the gruff exterior. People say Harbert has been to the Hells and back, and no one who sees him would dare question that rumor. He's never risen high among the Goodsons of the Traveler, but he is respected by all within the church's hierarchy. If you have to face a demon, a ghost, or a questionably-sourced cask of ale, you'll want Harbert's hatchet and his box of potions and powders at your side.</td>

<td>Bifgard Stonehouse</td>

<td> His flame-orange beard a shaggy tangle, Bifgard Stonehouse is quick to draw his axe at the first whiff of goblins, ghosts, and wights. For years, he has been working in stages to clear the ancient dwarf-hold of Silverden of goblins and undead almost single-handedly. He comes down from the mountains twice a year to re-supply his camp and make half-hearted attempts at recruiting some help in his task. Bifgard speaks very little until he's had a few ales, and then he speaks too much–becoming angry with himself (and anyone around him) whenever he lets slip one of Silverden's secrets, setting himself to perform an awful penance to atone to the Great Smith.</td>

Her brilliant blue eyes are patient and her manner is as soft and straight as her flowing silver-blonde hair. With her sword and her bow, Quelma has dogged the arch-lich Arameedi from one end of the World to the other. She has slain it six times, and six times the lich has risen. Quelma will continue her dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with Arameedi until she finds the hiding place of its phylactery or until it destroys her.</td>

Black-robed, gaunt, and pale with dark circles around his dark eyes, Goran's deep voice booms across the square beseeching all who will listen to make time for meditation on Death every day. Goran also sells a variety of amulets and potions that will ward off the curse of undeath, so that Death may be met peacefully and honorably.</td>

Zorimun's head is shaved and his mustache is long and waxed, though he often keeps both hidden from the sun with a white cotton cowl has he wanders the desert on his trusted mare. Every sun up and sun down, Zorimun prays to the Sun God asking the First Light and the Last Light to touch his flashing blade that he might strike down the dark followers of the Dead God. Zorimun is quietly going about his bloody work, seeking out the tent-camps and caves where the followers of the Dead God hide.</td>

<td>Inquisitor Marsolis</td>
<td>Female Tiefling Priestess</td>
<td> She tells her guests her name before they see her - Francesca. She lures them into confidence with a voice full of contrite abasement, sexual undertones, knowing humor. She laughs, she cries, she tells them she'll be flogged if she doesn't get the answers she needs. Whatever works. When she can, she walks behind them unseen, the soles of her boots whispering on the flagstones of her clean, spare chambers. Just as with any other tool, she uses violence sparingly and judicially... but first, if nothing else works, she steps from the shadows and pulls the hood from her head. When they see her crimson skin, they begin to scream; when they see the jet black ram's horns that curl from the back of her head and over her shoulders, they begin to confess.</td>

<td>Sir Nicolas of Eastmark</td>
<td>Male Human Sorcerer</td>
<td> Sir Nicolas is a peculiar sort of knight; he doesn't joust, or compete at the sword, or do any number of things that your average everyday knight would do. Instead, he wears finely tailored clothes, tasteful yet expensive jewelry, and personally oversees all of the kingdom's dealings with adventurers and would-be heroes. Having retired from adventuring himself at the ripe old age of 45, his dark hair (with gray wingtips, lovingly maintained) and trained grey eyes are a fixture around the palace. He prefers to do things the easy way, rather than the way that involves copious amounts of explosions, but make no mistake: he isn't called the Mage Knight of Eastmark for no reason.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dame Elmeara Dragonback</td>
<td>Female Dwarf Paladin</td>
<td> The first impression most people get of Elmeara is her armor: a set of brilliant white enameled plate, which under sunlight shimmers with a faint opalescence. Most trained warriors, sellswords, and hungry bandits scoff at such extravagance; after all, how experienced can one be without any battle damage on one's armor? Unfortunately for them, they are asking the wrong question. The right question: How good does Dame Elmeara have to be to come out of every fight with immaculate armor? The right answer: Very, very good.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Alexei van Valerya, the White Hat</td>
<td>Male Tiefling Assassin/Guard Captain</td>
<td> Assassination is an art, and a difficult one at that. For every noble who travels in an open carriage through a city filled with tall buildings, there are five more who don't eat their breakfast until their entire court has a bite first. And yet, a select few kingslayers still manage to turn a profit. Alexei van Valerya knows the art of killing important people better than any other bodyguard, mostly because up until a few years ago, he was on the side of the artists. The ex-assassin-turned-security-chief cuts an unassuming figure; at 5'10 he's not the tallest, and at 160 pounds he's not the bulkiest. What he is, is effective. From his swept-back black horns to his toes, Alexei is all business. Tales around the palace say that he personally kills at least one foreign spy before breakfast, and two before lunch. He fights with his bare hands, or with garrote wire, or with long, ten-inch dirks that he wears on his back, and when he does, he is completely silent.</td>

<td>Sygfellow Ottman</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Stonewarden</td>
<td> Sygfellow comes from a long line of stonewardens whose job it is to walk the long paths between the eastern brunmallow and northern grasslands where brigands often lurk seeking easy prey, or roaming barbarians encroach. Because of the fact that he's constantly on the move going to town to hamlet, he has an intimate knowledge of the inhabitants of each and is often sought out for news and tales and, when the wine is particularly fine, a song. Syg is the fifth generation of his family yo take on the stonewarden mantle. Syg stands four feet, nine inches tall and has long brown hair and amber eyes. Syg is so used to traveling the long trade roads that he travels quite light and can live fairly easily off of what the land provides. He knows every nook on the forest's edge where he can find safe respite and where to find the best fish and game. He's seen these roads to often and knows the paths so well, that he can smell when something is amiss. You'll know him by his rough green cloak and his compact yew bow that carries with him, and if he asks you your business, you'd do well to answer wisely. Sygfellow does not suffer fools kindly.</td>

You can find him, more often than not, tending to the wounded Lord's Alliance soldiers in the med tents of Qui. His words are brief and to the point, but he is kind and well-mannered. He heads a church of Torm in the city of Qui called "The Beacon" where he teaches mercy, healing and kindness. Those who meet Sir Aaron on the street or in his church will often find him lost in thought, dwelling on those he could not save and praying for those he is still trying to save.</td>

<td> A paladin of torm and war veteran, he wears a leather armored kilt and a light leather tunic at all times. He has seen more wars and single combat encounters in his life than most can honestly speak of, and its left him a bit crazed or blood lusted, its hard to tell. His eyes are wide, and his head's got patches of hair all about it in between the patches that have either fallen out or been ripped out. He is nearly maniacal in his desire to drive evil from the land and he's happy to engage in long conversations with those who would help him do it. You can find him training with the other brothers of the First Light Monastery, east of the High Forest.</td>

<td>Talal</td>
<td>Male Half-Elf Mystic / con-artist (neutral selfish)</td>
<td> Moral ambiguity personified with sandy blonde hair and a charming smile; a wink of his green eyes invites you into his secret. Most faiths have a secret cabal wherein special rites, prayers, and practices are rarely disclosed to the layman. However as a man of half truths and half lies, Talal can fit in to any one of these. Talal's specialty is knowing where these rituals take place and either owns or at least knows the location of cabalistic items of power.  </td>

<td>Keandra</td>
<td>Female Tiefling Warlock / demon hunter</td>
<td> Not everyone believes that hunting demons is a fulfilling career path. Thus was the belief of the arch devil Ezatan, who therefore sub-contracted his end of a deal to a young and desperate tiefling girl. Now that she is older, Keandra hunts demons with efficiency and indifference. Having no personal vendetta against the abyssal spawns, she finds no joy ridding the world of their evil. To her, it's just a job.</td>

<td> The body was finally still beneath him, but he could feel the blood soaking into his pants. Still, he held the knife, hilt against the body's back, a few more seconds until he was sure it was only his own breath rasping in the dark cellar. "Balch, you're getting sloppy," he muttered to himself as he willed his left hand to release the quarry's horn and slowly withdraw the ten inch dirk. The darkened skin of the tiefling on the floor seemed to go ashy in the inky black pool of its own blood. He'd earned this bounty, but at what cost? Licking his lips unconsciously, he knew the self-flagellation tonight would be particularly intense.</td>

He initially has a gruff demeanor, but becomes friendly enough once you known him for a while. A follower of Marthammor Duin, he aims to explore new lands and protect his fellow travelers and any people who he might meet on the road. Accustomed to hilly terrain and mountains, his recent travels though an unholy mountain pass have led him into combat with wicked undead far too often for his tastes, and he would welcome any help in exterminating this threat to the locals and travellers.</td>

Through his veins runs a sliver of metallic dragon blood, granting him power beyond that of an ordinary kobold. He is dedicated to his duty and speaks very little. And when he does speak, he speaks softly, barely more than a whisper.</td>

He prefers to lead from the front and take a cautious approach to most things. Having survived numerous battles where patience, not the might of a sword arm, was the deciding factor. He is merciful to most beings, believing that everybody has the chance to turn to the light. However he acts without mercy or quarter to beings of evil and those who help them.</td>

Driven and focused to the task at hand, Sivak Nala hunts down the dark forces of the world with equal measures of grace and cold malice.</td>

Cadrielda is shy and fidgety, and seems to consider interacting with customers to be a necessary evil. She can barely stay afloat because she is always tanking in stray animals. Unknown to most, she was once a druid, but was banished from her circle for dabbling in science, and many of the goods she sells are actually of her own invention.</td>

Often the only thing that Mekaela will ask in exchange for a bit of information on demons - or any demon in particular - is that her client keep her informed of any new relevant knowledge they gain. That, and that they spread word of her services, as she is so unremarkable it is understandably hard to do much networking in person.</td>

She's now a columnist for The Astral Quill, and has been trying to secure an interview with someone that will take her career to the next level.</td>

<td>Eubor Westmin</td>
<td>Undead Arms Dealer</td>
<td> Eubor was once a person of some description, turned undead by some necromancer of some other description. He doesn't care for the particulars. Upon being raised, Eubor found that being an undead minion wasn't for him so he left to pursue other options. He now makes a living by taking weapons from dungeons, battlefields, etc and selling them. It's not a noble living, nor a living at all for Eubor, but it occupies eternity.</td>

<td>Yulmon Taed</td>
<td>Male Human Author</td>
<td> Yulmon occupies his time writing short stories, as well as occasional re-imaginings of folklore. His first book, The Boy and the Sweet +4 Shortsword was a big hit, giving him the fanbase to leave his miserable job as a haberdasher and write full time. He mainly sells his stories to The Astral Quill. Right now he's working on his first novel, A Game of Fancy Chairs.</td>

<td>Hirai Doyle</td>
<td>Male Child Detective?</td>
<td> Hirai is a child who calls himself a detective, and seems to possess intelligence and skills unlike any child should have. He also looks remarkably similar to a teenage detective from the area who went missing the same day the boy appeared, though with some glasses. This is of course just a coincidence, obviously. He frequently gets into dangerous situations, left to save the day using various gadgets created for him by his elderly gnome friend, Instructor Christie Herschel.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Daven Frealor</td>
<td>Male Human Actor</td>
<td> Daven is an actor, that much is simple. His real last name is Radtaie, but he changed it as there was already an actor named Daven Radtaie and there are rules to this business. He's considered semi-famous, holding a lot of minor roles in the big plays and some major roles in the smaller ones. His upcoming gig, standing in for a larger actor who quit acting to pursue a career in haberdashing, could be what he needs to break into the big leagues. His acting's fine, but he's just a bit too dramatic at times. If you want more detail, Mepis Soutan once reviewed his performance in Undeath of a Salesman.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dot</td>
<td>Male and Female Human Twins</td>
<td> Pip and Dot are male and female, respectfully, and are identical twins. As kids it was cute, but as they grew older their interests diverged and now they just get on each other's nerves. Pip is an enchanter, and Dot is a ranger. Both are highly respected by those around them, and both are proper and well mannered. Put them together and they argue like children. Without having talked to each other in years, they each met and married one of a set of twins, Tim and Tammy, with similar circumstances and none of the four knowing anything about the situation. Coincidentally, Pip and Dot's older brother Jon is good friends with Tim and Tammy's older sister Jane, having met outside the situation. That first family reunion was a confusing one.</td>

<td>Bryce Bladewalker</td>
<td>Male. Human druid. Serial Killer.</td>
<td> Favourite saying: The only thing I'll trust a woman to do is stay dead. Personality: A real go-getter, he can't stand laziness. Alcoholic. Widowed. Important memories: His wife, leaving him for a wizard whose every need was attended by magical servants. Strangling that wizard with his bear hands. An alcohol-fuelled haze of pain and regret.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Stonebeard</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Mason</td>
<td> "Stonebeard" not going by his birth name due to a contempt for his father who is considered "A lousy drunkard" even among dwarfs. Due to this he has a unusual fondness of "family values" and has a strong moral code. He travels around the human cities offering his extensive knowledge on stonework.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Antonio Pyre</td>
<td>Male Human Acolyte</td>
<td> Acolytes are often seen as unsociable to regular folk. Antonio is a man of common tastes, which has left him unable to gain higher status in his church. He would spend his evenings drinking and whoring. His sins should not be taken for complacency in religion, in his sinful conquests he would take the lowest of the low into the arms of god.</td>

<td>Evylin Silverwind</td>
<td>Female Elf(?) Adviser-to-the-king</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Stron Leather-Arm</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Butcher</td>
<td> Stron is a brazen fellow, harsh of word and sharp of tongue. Many distrust him as a half-orc, his profession does not help public opinion. While many butchers do not care much for the final product, Stron is a true gourmet, not cut of meat is too fine for his taste. He shares this only with his more friendly customers.</td>

<td>Sapphire</td>
<td>Female Human Prostitute/Spy</td>
<td> Many prostitutes in the slums are driven to it by lack of options. Sapphire however has carved her own path from day one, she was a sharp young lady, too good for a brothel, but she was happy with it. After a few years, she knew how eager men (and some women) were to spill their guts. The lesson Sapphire learned was playing with politics was much more profitable.</td>

<td>Marrak Sunstone</td>
<td>Male Human Arena-Fighter</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Biri Bluebarrel</td>
<td>Female Halfling Brewer</td>
<td> From a long line of famous brewers, Biri is no less skilled. The fine blue-tinted ale her family is named for however is like poison to her tongue. Biri is cursed to never enjoy her gifts. She is loved by many, and despite not drinking makes any party lively.</td>

<td>Thalar Yet</td>
<td>Female Dragonborn Wandering Teacher</td>
<td> Thalar always found an odd love of humans, interested in their quarrels and struggles. She alone has become almost a legend travelling from village to village, every one left better off for it. She was taught well while young possessing great knowledge in healing, agriculture and combat. Thalar's love of humans even lead to her discarding the name of her clan for a name that humans found easier to say.</td>

<td>Skarrak Sunlight</td>
<td>Male Tiefling Priest</td>
<td> Masochist, is the one word that comes to mind when people speak of Skarrak. He is hated for his appearance, yet he retains a paragon of honor, virtue and piety. Through great pain he has removed his horns, over years cut away his tail. A man wounded in mind, some pity him above all others. (Phew 10, I should probably stop now)</td>

<td> Old man Ravn has a tale for every night of the year, and knows more songs than there are stars in the sky. He wonders the northlands in search of heroes and adventurers to question, and will happily allow a road-weary party to share his fire in exchange for their story. His sage advice has more than once saved kingdoms from collapse, and is a welcome guest at any lord's dwelling.</td>

<td>Winna</td>
<td>Female Human Barmaid</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Valdi Galanodel</td>
<td>Female Elf Ranger</td>
<td> A strong but paranoid leader, Valdi is fiercely protective of both her land and her kin. She views outsiders with vehement disdain, and rarely allows trespassers on her land to pass unchallenged. Her pride has led to friction with the nearby human and dwarf settlements, and both are becoming increasingly concerned by her readiness to slay any who put so much as a toe across her borders.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lord Kristian Fiermann</td>
<td>Male Human Lord</td>
<td> As corrupt as they come, Lord Fiermann sees himself a strong and capable man, though in fact his strength comes from his wife and her family, whose ambition far outstrips his. He frequently raises taxes to support his wife's "projects", and turns a blind eye to the numerous missing villagers who seem to wind up in his dungeons. He won't have anything to do with dark magic, though it is clear his wife is secretly attempting to summon demons to further her own goals.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jackson Stern</td>
<td>Male Human Miscreant</td>
<td> Everyone in town knows Jackson, forever in trouble with the Town Guard. He's a troubled boy, and his petty crimes are going to see him hung. He strives to be the best thief this side of the Eastern Sea, but is so clumsy he mostly ends up causing minor damage to properties instead, before failing to steal anything before the Town Guard turns up to drag him back to the cell in the barracks. They joke he should be paying them rent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Father Osmund</td>
<td>Male Human Cleric (War Domain)</td>
<td> Old Father Osmund is a devout racist. Though he outwardly strives to "better the world", he is zealous to the point of fanaticism. He can be found wherever there is a human lord looking to stamp out a local non-human community, or otherwise spends his time persecuting non-human members of society. He seeds rumours, sometimes even planting incriminating evidence in dwellings, before offering to be the one to deal with them once the mob is roused.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tess D'Orvic</td>
<td>Female Human Sorcerer</td>
<td> Tess is the epitome of bad luck. Though she is one of the strongest sorcerers in the land, her art rarely manifests itself in the way she intends. She's on the run now, after that time she agreed to help deal with a ghost in the town cemetery, only to accidentally disturb all the other resting souls into haunting the town. When she reported to the council, so deep was her anxiety that her wild magic flared once again, and now none of them can talk, except to make farm animal noises. The price on her head is quite large these days.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Kydd</td>
<td>Female(?) Human(?) Child(?)</td>
<td> No-one knows anything about Kydd's origins. She is only ever seen before a town suffers a cataclysmic event, and stories of her appearances go back centuries. There have only been two occasions where she has spoken, and the persons to which she spoke became heroes of legend. No town has ever survived longer than 24 hours after she appears there. Perhaps she is the cause, or merely a warning?</td>

<td> Greg is a generic old guy who sits in the corner of the tavern and occasionally shouts 'Lord Sprinkleton? Ah, not many people know the story of Lord Sprinkleton these days'. Unfortunately, he doesn't know all that much. He will only ever recount his childhood on the farm and explain vaguely relevant elven and dwarfish conspiracies because he is violently racist.</td>

<td>Rod Osmington</td>
<td>Angry Merchant</td>
<td> Rod has just escaped a troubled relationship with his father, in which his father decided to give him his full inheritance in chickens and land. Rod is now seeking people who will trade chickens for chicken food or actual money, and is therefore first seen leading thirty chickens or so. He does not like talking about it and will be gruff to any that ask why he has so many chickens.</td>

<td> John is a cat, who will follow the party around. Flip a coin: Heads, he's the familiar of a suitably powerful wizard. Tails, he's literally just a cat. He is exceptionally stupid, and will often run off to stupid places. If the party decides to follow him around, he will consistently get them into trouble by biting important people, running away to secret bandit hideouts, and attacking the wizard's spellbook.</td>

<td>Triggart Darkfeather</td>
<td>Tengu, Merchant</td>
<td> I dont have time to do the Ten but Ill toss a few in here. Two of whom I played before starting DMing, Ive found them useful as NPCs because I like them. Small and pale and a great desire to be evil. Sometimes sides with good for his own later benefit. Wanted nothing more than to become a Lich god. Hated good Necromancers more than anything in the world. Hated his father for cruel magical experiments. VERY strong hatred of anything evil. Able to detect alignments, worshiped a troll god. Used a sword that was too big for him and was way smarter than him. After his people were killed he was raised from infancy by a gang of human thieves. Believed himself for a long time to be human, thinks everyone sees him as human. He often thinks he needs to explain to people that he isnt human. Because he was raised by humans he behaves like a human and not an elf. Mildly racist against any other race. See's Tengu as inherintly superior. Loves shiny things. Makes no bones about using other races for his own benefit. This is all I have time for. Id love to do more but maybe Ill comment again later if I can.</td>

One day, he came across a shrine below a statue of a storm god, with a chest. The chest contained armour, robes and weapons, all marked with the sign of the storm (lightning bolts, wind and clouds). He believes that the storm spirits chose him for great things.</td>

<td>Keranth Arbright</td>
<td>Male Human Wizard</td>
<td> Keranth is about 68 years old, has a heavily lined face and long white hair and a short beard. He tells people this: He has spent the majority of his life on purely theoretical studies of the arcane, and has recently sold his house to go travelling. The truth is this: He is a necromancer, whose spellbook is his own flesh. Spells are tattooed onto his body using the blood of innocents as ink. The main hint of this is that he does not have a spellbook. He is a generally kindly fellow with a cheerful attitude to life, whenever in company.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jeorg Spravahich</td>
<td>Male Orc Weaponsmith</td>
<td> Some people, upon entering the weaponsmiths trade, settle for reliability and a steady income by manufacturing swords, axes, shields, the usual. Not Jeorg. Jeorg specialises in experimental seige weaponry, with emphasis on "mental". Ballistae which fire smaller ballistae, giant crossbows which fire metal shrapnel in almost every direction, trebuchets with a range of several kilometers but fall apart every time you fire them, he makes them all. And as he watches the test-shots, he laughs a deep hearty laugh that hints at the insanity within. (Based on this guy.)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach</td>
<td>Male Gnome Barbarian</td>
<td> It is not exactly certain that his name really is "Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach", everyone simply assumes that it is because that is what he introduces himself as. His speech is distorted, however, by the ritual piercings of a member of his tribe who is on a Blood Quest. This piercing takes the form of a relatively large iron bar passing through both cheeks, impaling the tounge in passing, with symbols of his god on the end of each bar, holding it in place. He also abhors writing, making communication all but impossible. He has settled in the countryside far from his homeland, as some unknown incident has erased his memory of the details of Blood Quest, he only remembers that he is on one, and that the bar may not be removed before it is complete. His speech is incomprehensible. For example, "Can you direct me to the nearest tavern?" becomes "Chlaag urghh urechh ee oo aa eggaech aggerrr?"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kimberly Parish</td>
<td>Female Vampire Innkeeper</td>
<td> Kimberly tends a bar in a dive town, and yet somehow the bar patrons are unusually quiet and docile once through the doors. Unlike any other inn in town, disputes are settled calmly, fights are unheard of, and lewd behaviour is nonexistent. This may have something to do with the covered bite marks on the patrons shoulders, and what may be hidden behind the scarf Kimberly keeps wrapped around her neck.</td>

<td>Vonrick the Valient</td>
<td>Male Human Paladin/Knight</td>
<td> Vonrick is the quinessential knight; he is tall, strongly-built and honourable as well as charming. He only hopes that none find out his gifts with the sword and lance came as a deal with a demon. The price was the life of his own brother, who Vonrick led to the lake and drowned as a young teen.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Peter of the Old Order</td>
<td>Male Human Cleric</td>
<td> Under his cream-coloured cloak and old roughspun tunic and with his gentle way of speaking, one may confuse Peter as a man against violence. However, he is a recruiter for one of the strongest military-churches in the land and had no qualms against wielding his hammer against those he sees as sinners.</td>

<td>Sir Michael Mill</td>
<td>Male Human Sword-fighting instructor</td>
<td> Michael showed great promise with the sword in his youth, and was even knighted for his efforts in battle. However, at the age of 21, he stepped in a bear trap. The foot became infected and it was amputed. He now trains the younger boys in his town on swordplay.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Maggie Bluestream</td>
<td>Female Half-Elf birdkeeper</td>
<td> Maggie is a Half-Elf. She understands that there are those in this world who do not take kindly to species-mixing. Her brother had warned her as much before he was captured in a raid when they were young. She has cut off the points to her ears, takes in the sun as much as she can, and plays the fool when she hears Elvish being spoken. She dresses herself in Human clothing, and has stopped practising any customs from her childhood. She has been put in charge of the messenger-pigeons for the Baron, and prays that one day she finds Elves contacting him, so she may try to find a home with people more accepting.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Khyban</td>
<td>Female Dragonborn General</td>
<td> Khyban was never meant to become a General. She had six brothers, all of them strong and capable of command. It was Khyban's lot to work with potions, or inter-clan diplomacy, or to help raise the younglings of her brothers. Dragonborn clans don't often look kindly on those who reject the role given to them. But when a Dragonborn returns home one night displaying the severed head of a Hill Giant, before they have even fully reached adulthood, it is impossible to ignore them. Khyban knows how to reward captains and soldiers who please her in battle. Displeasing Khyban rarely happens now.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sir Annory Garfield</td>
<td>Male Human Captain</td>
<td> Though his family name does carry importance in the kingdom, there isn't a knight who thinks Annory has earned the respect himself. Sir Annory has notoriously been part of battles that were already largely won, or were an easy victory. He has always requested to be stationed near less-troublesome areas. However, none of this works to lessen his arrogance, and he will inflate his achievements in battle whenever his honour is questioned.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Darber Claytop</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Diplomat</td>
<td> Darber is perhaps the only famous Dwarf in the kingdom who didn't earn such fame with a weapon. His crowning achievement thus far has been his negotiations with Karg the Big. Karg was an Orc chieftan who had grown his war pack large enough to threaten the city. However, using his snakelike tongue, Darber was able to stave off the Orc invasion for four full days; enough time for reinforcement cavalry to arrive and smash the Orc host. Darber now works within the city as a highly-respected ambassador.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Captain Bobbla of the Cerulean Shadow</td>
<td>Female Halfling Pirate</td>
<td> When she is in the company of other pirate captains, Bobbla will brag that her ship hasn't needed to seek a shore in over eight years. Her success with ship-raiding has been such that the sea provides all the treasure she needs. She leads her crew of Halflings in the long, blue-painted ship known as the Cerulean Shadow. If Bobbla wishes to remain unseen in a shadow, she will do so. If she desires that her ship remain unseen in broad daylight, it too will do so. No non-Halfling have ever survived once they step on Bobbla's ship, so the secret to the boat's stealth remains a mystery.</td>

<td>Gretchen Farseer</td>
<td>Female Human Soothsayer</td>
<td> Gretchen was once a talented seer for her marshland clan. She had correctly predicted bandit raids, locust swarms, plague, lightning storms and even wars. Her predictions have saved her clan innumerable times, and for this she has been treated with great reverence within her clan. It is a shame that her talents have dwindled with her advanced age, however. It has been four years since she has claimed to see anything but the supposedly incoming "ocean of fire".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Elena Redlegs</td>
<td>Female Human Goblin Queen</td>
<td> Goblins attacker her village. Her daughter was killed in the raid by a Goblin chieftan. She begged her king for help, but none was provided. So she took her kitchen knife, sneaked into the Goblin cave, somehow found the sleeping chieftan and took his head. She was found soaked in his blood, and carrying his head. For this, the Goblins kneeled to her and proclaimed her the new chieftan. For the past two years, Elena has led raids with her ever-growing Goblin clan on her former king's outposts for revenge of his inaction.</td>

<td>Handsome Andre</td>
<td>Male Human creeper</td>
<td> I can offer some that were discontinued from previous campaigns that I liked: An expert marksman who could thread a needle with an arrow at 100 yards despite only being 13 years old. Will no doubt be a legend in years to come. Very shy and has unfortunate bumfluff. Physically quite weak, and cannot finish a sentence without his voice cracking. Once was nearly killed by an Owlbear. Well known in his small town for bringing home large game from hunts with expert killing blows. Andre is a 1/10 ugly creepy dude with a smoking hot 10/10 wife. He was given the ironic nickname "Handsome" after he married his extremely attractive and loyal wife who is beloved by the town. Unknown to the townsfolk Andre made a pact to sell his soul to a demon when he was young in order to make his high school crush fall in love with him forever. (In my game he was a warlock but he doesn't have to be) He was an adventurer for several years, and uses the money he earned to make a living as a patron of local sculptors, masons and painters, paying their living expenses for an extortionate proportion of the profits from their work.</td>

<td> A handsome elf with golden hair and an uneasy smile. He is sympathetic to those who suffer, but he is very cautious to meddle in others affairs: "That is nature's way." He is (or was) the caretaker of a sacred place, deep in an ancient forest. He is loathe to share the secrets of that place.</td>

<td>Mairiel Moonblossom</td>
<td>Female Wood Elf Druid</td>
<td> Long, silky amber hair frames the elf-maiden's sharp features and deep blue eyes. She lives lonely, even by wood elf standards. She spends most of her days meditating in a remote sacred grove in an ancient forest that is filled with terrors. She knows many secrets of the forest, but the promise of uncovering its deeper secrets can draw her away from her sacred grove.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eloranae Mistdancer</td>
<td>Female Wood Elf Ranger</td>
<td> The elf wears a dull cloak clasped beneath her chin with a brooch of swirling crystal; her iridescent green eyes gaze wistfully as her platinum hair flutters gently in the wind. Eloranae has been walking to the ends of the world, looking for what few wood elves remain. She is the last of her house and carries an immense sorrow behind her eyes. She is a true friend, but unleash's an incredible fury upon her enemies, sometimes waiting decades or centuries before the opportune moment to take revenge.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Corian Leafstrider</td>
<td>Male Wood Elf Scout</td>
<td> The blonde elf tosses his hair over his shoulder and stifles his laugh long enough to take a swallow of wine from the skin that hangs about his neck. When set on a task, Corian will carry it out with unerring determination; his family sometimes jokingly chide him as "Half-Elven," suggesting he may carry the blood of men within him. When not on a specific mission, Corian is a merry companion; keeping company mostly with men and halflings in the travelers' camps in the forest or at the travelers' along the road. His family, especially his brother, thinks Corian is a troublemaker; the truth is Corian feels the sadness and loss that others do, perhaps more sharply, and he drinks and makes-merry so as not to be consumed by the gloom.</td>

<td>Cirthoeil II of House Darkwater</td>
<td>Male Wood Elf King</td>
<td> A muscular elf with golden brown hair and a grim countenance. Cirthoeil has reigned as the King of the Shadowwood for centuries, though few outside his woodland realm have ever heard of him; he is a just ruler among his people, but he is not kind to outsiders. In his youth, he traveled widely and fought bravely against many earthly and otherworldly evils. Possessing no magical gifts of his own, he is especially jealous and suspicious of spellcasters or those who carry items of great magical power with them.</td>

<td> This petite, sleepy-eyed brunette was beautiful once, and she can still enchant: It's in the way she moves. Winnie has had a hard go of it, she rarely laughs anymore, and no one seems to know where she grew up. She's been a staple of the taverns and brothels of the River District for years, and she's notched some impressive tricks into her belt: Fearsome outlaws, well-known ship captains, wealthy merchants, and "the world's greatest thief." She used to be the life of the party, but the joy of ale and wine have begun to wane, as does her beauty.</td>

<td>Aldorn Braxton</td>

<td> A dark-eyed man with a winning grin scans the room with his keen eyes. Aldorn is a treasure-hunter, a thrill-seeker, an excellent friend to those who will lead him to opportunities for gold and glory. He claims to be the "world's greatest thief," and he's well-known in the low districts and in high society alike, though he's not always welcome in either. Aldorn is quick to draw on his wits and his knife for any who doubt his claims, but he knows when to run: "The better part of greatness is staying alive."</td>

<td> A portly man with several tattoos mumbles incoherently from under his long, unkempt grey beard. The people of the River District call him "Tim," and he answers, but no one really knows his name (of course, they call him "Hobo," and he answers to that too. He is usually harmless, mumbling about needing coin at passers by; erratically, he will last out with racist tirades, particularly directing them at dwarves. He has been stumbling around the River District for at least fifteen years; although it's not clear if he even knows who or what he was before then, he does sport an unusual tattoo of a man-spearing-a-shark-eating-a-dragon-eating-a-dwarf.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sir Ayrin Favager</td>
<td>Male Human Knight</td>
<td> Sir Ayrin clanks about in his steel armor, carrying a warhammer, a shield, and a holier-than-thou attitude. He grew up as a commoner, a blacksmith's apprentice, but he was raised up to knighthood after he saved a powerful lord's son in a skirmish with a rival at a tavern. Sir Ayrin had been proud of his work at the forge; now he's even prouder of his elevated social rank. He tends to be suspicious that people are cheating him; after being offered the position of knight, he first refused believing the lord's messenger was mocking him.</td>

<td> Atop Ole's big frame sits a red-round head with dark, short-cropped hair, dark stubble of a beard, and watery blue eyes. He has sailed on trading vessels up and down the coast for several years. Ole tends to be forgetful about details, but he's reliable enough when it comes to the tasks aboard a ship. He loves to share bawdy stories and jokes over some wine or ale, and once he starts drinking, he rarely stops until he's snoring.</td>

<td> Unshaven and unwashed, Baris stinks of sheep and looks even worse, clad in filthy leathers and a ragged cloak. He owns a few dozen sheep and scrapes a living off sale of wool (and occasionally mutton) that he trades with the merchant caravans that venture far enough north to pass his homestead. Ever since he caught a caravan guard flirting with her, Baris fears that his pretty young wife will leave him for someone more handsome and dashing. Baris was twice before, but each of his previous wives left him childless when she died.</td>

She hires her services (many as they are) out for a steep price, but she always delivers: "No one does it better than me," she says with a sweet smile. Most kills are strictly business, but some kills she enjoys, as she seeks the men who killed her father when she was a girl.</td>

He spends much of his time in the seclusion of his study; on occasion, he visits the school's library or walks the grounds, wearing a heavy black cloak with a hood drawn about his face. Nothing is known of Gerwac before he founded the school a few decades ago, choosing what is believed to be a haunted mountain for its grounds. His school is as secretive as he is; little is known about the school to those outside it, and it is whispered that the students fear him tremendously.</td>

<td>Male Human Curio-Shopkeeper</td>
<td> The spry old man has silver gray hair and whiskers and ruddy skin stretched across his long hooked nose and the rest of his bony face; he eyes his customers keenly. "Welcome, welcome! May I collect the dust from your feet? Travelers' feet are full of interesting sands and lints from far off places—quite useful for magic." The old man doesn't wait for an answer but drops his book and scrambles over the counter to begin collecting dirt from his customers' feet, collecting it into small glass vials. He is cautious about local laws, but he knows a good customer when he sees one; he raises his voice speaking loud enough that anyone out on the street could hear him, "Though I don't know how to do any magic myself."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Torrek Holdeger</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Armorer</td>
<td> The dwarf pensively strokes the long dark brown braid of his beard; his other hand rests atop the hammer strapped to his belt. Torrek is a perfectionist; trained by a master craftsman, his own skill exceeds that of his former mentor. Since becoming a refugee after the destruction of his kingdom, Torrek has been reduced to taking on journeyman work at various forges. Torrek would like to settle some place quiet where he can open his own forge; he hates the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Torgrim Holdeger</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Soldier</td>
<td> The dwarf clad in mail carries a large battleaxe; his long black beard is tidy and combed out straight. Torgrim learned some rudimentary healing skills while serving as a soldier to his king; he never had the patience to study the healing arts properly. Since the goblin horde over-ran his kingdom, Torgrim has taken on a variety of jobs as a mercenary or enforcer. Torgrim is fond of drinking, carousing, and fighting; he enjoys life in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jurk Ironbiter</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Berserker</td>
<td> The dwarf seems to be staring at nothing, his auburn beard a wild tangle; then he stares right at you. Jurk's gaze is unsettling, he rarely speaks, and he is fearless in battle. His grip on sanity slipped after seeing the goblins smash his king's army and take the king himself. Jurk will fiercely defend the honor of his fallen king at the least provocation.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cirolas Summerstar</td>
<td>Male High Elf Storyteller</td>
<td> The lanky, brown-haired elf looks about with his wide green eyes, taking in everything. He knows the histories and songs of many peoples and places, their legends and their endings, and can tell their stories so they are all-at-once epic, personal, comedic, and tragic. He knows how to tell a story, but he also knows how to listen for one: "And then?" nodding eagerly. He belongs to an ancient and noble house and is seeking some secret piece of lore.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jelenneth Wintermoon</td>
<td>Female High Elf Oracle</td>
<td> The sight of the thin blonde elf with brilliant blue eyes and a faraway gaze fills you with a pang of loss. She has watched the stars for centuries; she knows the doom they foretell and it fills her with sadness. Jelenneth longs to uncover new portents and omens that contradict what she has foreseen. She is often distracted from the most pressing questions by the opportunity to learn something new by following a tangential train of thought.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thrakk, the Chief of the Palefists, Lord of Eastern Horde, Slayer of Men, Eater of Elves</td>
<td>Male Orc Warlord</td>
<td> Thrakk is bigger, meaner, and smarter than the other 10,000 orcs of the Eastern Horde; don't get in his way. He ascended to chief of the Palefist clan at a relatively young age by stabbing the previous chief through the back with his blade, cutting his heart out, and devouring it; ever since, he's been uniting the Eastern clans through a combination of intimidation, bribery, slaughter, and lies. Thrakk has aspirations to drive the Eastern Horde over the mountains to invade the Western Kingdoms; if he can and if he adds the Northern clans to his horde, he may well conquer the world. If you meet Thrakk, chances are you are already dead and on his dinner plate; if you're alive, he must see some use for you, and he'll most likely kill you when that use has expired.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kuranath</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Pit-Fighter</td>
<td> Scars cover much of his nearly hairless head and neck, and he often cradles an oddly shaped brass knuckle in his hand. He enjoys being around people, but he is often silent among them. He is an escaped slave, and he is frightened that his cruel former masters may find him: "I never stay in one place too long." He despises fighting in the pits, but it's all he's ever known, and he wins.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lurg</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Thug</td>
<td> The half-orc's dark eyes dimly follow the fly that has been attracted to his revolting scent, as he lines up to swat it with his club. Lurg is big and stupid, but he can follow simple instructions well enough. He will readily follow anyone who promises him the opportunity to smash things, taking greater satisfaction from this than from anything gold can buy. Lurg is easily distracted by food, and he is particularly fond of wines and pungent cheeses.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gaeryon Vyn Dordevetym</td>

<td> The cloth merchant laughs nervously as he wipes the sweat from his brow with a lace-trimmed silk handkerchief. Gaeryon is a member of a wealthy merchant family who owns the exclusive a share of rights to export of the cloth produced by the weavers' guild in the city. He travels the roads in a yearly cycle with a small cadre of guards and a man-servant, purchasing raw wool from rural sheepherders and bringing them cloth and a handful of other dry goods produced in the city. Gaeryon is friendly but he despises travel: if he had his way, he'd work in the family's offices and stay at home with his wife and children year-round.</td>

<td>Male Human Knight</td>
<td> Sir Roderick, handsome, tall, and blonde, stares at you with some of the sweetest blue eyes you've ever seen. One of the king's boldest knights, Sir Roderick has gained renown throughout the realm for his brave deeds. He rose to prominence by winning the princess's name day tournament: there is a rumor that he harbors a secret love for her. Sir Roderick plays the part of the pure and genteel knight well, but he's actually quite a rake when he thinks no one from court is watching.</td>

<td>Valaerys Nightspear</td>
<td>Female Dark Elf Warrior</td>
<td> Silver-haired with sharp features, Valaerys fled from her home in the Underdark after attempting to spirit away a pair of frightened young human girls who had been taken as slaves during a surface raid. Moved by compassion, she managed to help one girl escape, but the other was run down by her former comrades in the attempt. Having been seen in the attempt, she had no choice but to run or to face death, as would have been the punishment meted out by the spider priestess. She and her young companion have been wandering the shadow lands for 15 years now, taking on what small quests they can while avoiding encounters with other dark elves at all cost.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mirmarye "Mimi" Sohuster</td>
<td>Female Human Assassin</td>
<td> As a young girl, dark elves raided Mimi's village, kidnapping her and her sister. Mimi escaped with the help of a dark elf warrior, who has since served as her guardian and companion while they wandered the shadow lands as refugees. Growing up on the move and among the rough and the lowly, Mimi became quite good at sneaking, stealing, and knifing her way out of many desperate situations. Mimi has grown to be a beautiful dark-haired young woman, but she is grim and pessimistic, harboring suspicion against strangers, especially human men and all elves, except for her companion.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sister Niradella Tariskoff</td>
<td>Female Human Priestess</td>
<td> Hailing from the North, Niradella is the winter fury, the cold wind that cuts to the bone; her icy stare hides the true meaning of her words. Her widowed mother, unable to support her, left her to be raised as an initiate in to the Storm King's Temple of Winter as a small girl. By the aid of her instructors and her Northern blood, she has grown powerful: well-versed in magical lore, skilled in the healing arts, capable of manipulating the forces of winter, and deadly to the temple's enemies. Though loyal to the temple's hierarchy and purposes, Niradella does not know how her father died nor what became of her mother; the chance to uncover these truths could tempt her to break her vows.</td>

Thia is a nurturing soul who loves to cook for her guests: They say she makes the best pies this side of the old forest.

<td> A friendly little chap with an unfortunate scar in the shape of an onion on his left cheek. Watters poles the ferry that serves as the primary crossing for the river at the edge of his village; he enjoys talking to travelers. When he's not at the ferry, he's probably out walking the woods--a practice he finds therapeutic since he gave up gambling. He owes a considerable gambling debt to a bandit: Occasionally, the ne'er-do-well presses him to ferry him across the river in the dead of night as a favor.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Finnan Wetherwise</td>
<td>Male Halfling Pickpocket</td>
<td> The halfling scowls into his mug of ale, bushy brown eyebrows arching over dark brown eyes. Finnan will lift anything of value that is not tied down, and he may even try to take some of those things as well. He is loyal to his friends, but he is not keen on making any new ones. When he spots something valuable, Finnan will brood and stare at it until he can work out how to lift it.</td>

<td> The ruddy-faced halfling puffs out his chest and reaches for the shortsword at his belt and marches in your direction. The son of a gardener, his parents named him Barnabas Arthor Tinsparkle at birth; he started calling himself Baznar Metalshine as a youth because he thought it sounded tougher than Barney Tinsparkle. Though generally well-intentioned, Baznar can be a bit of a nosy, self-righteous ass. Baznar knows everything about everyone in the village, but if you call him "Barney" you can forget about getting any help from him.</td>

Shendi loves new visitors and will ask them all kinds of questions. Unlike his father, he is charismatic and doesn't gloom over the loss of his mother as frequently. Shendi is good at names, that much he remembers and if adventurers tell him where they are going, the next time they return he will ask them about their travels and sit and talk with them for a while.

He vowed that he would do whatever it took to learn how to cast magic missile (and only magic missile) as much as possible for the rest of his life. He has a younger brother who's a failed necromancer, who looks up to him and is trying to make his own mark as an artificer.</td>

<td>Male Human Necromancer/Artificer</td>
<td> Gavin's younger brother who wanted to learn magic like his older brother could do. Unfortunately, the only one available to teach Devin was an old necromancer in the depths of senility, so poor Devin didn't get the best education. While trying to animate a cat skeleton for practice outside a neighboring town one day, a female elf druid caught him in the act. Rather than immediately condemn him for his unnatural behavior, the druid offered him a chance to just drop the whole necromancy thing if he couldn't get the skeleton to animate. He couldn't, and so the druid connected him with the town artificer, who he is now apprenticed to. His early efforts are poor but he shows some promise.</td>

<td> The Strathmoors are elderly innkeepers in kind of a shady part of town. The two mother/daughter and both advanced in age and nearly indistinguishable. No one, without expending some serious energy, has ever seen the two of them at the same time. They are soft spoken and gentle,, and turn a blind eye to the illegal activities happening within their inn.</td>

<td> High up on the food chain that is the Daggerford Thieves Guild. Has a scar in the shape of a smiling face, on his face.

<td>Gnome Wizard</td>
<td> A slightly crazy, but incredibly smart wizard who helps the party overcome challenges.

Though retired now he still helps out the adventurers cause. Motivating them with a story of his epic and daring quests, providing a first hand advice on a situation, or even helping defend the group with his signature duel shield style of fighting. If you spot the man carrying two shields ask him for a story he's sure to entertain you with a great one.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Howard Jackal</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Bandit</td>
<td> Howard Jackal for the most part of his life he has been a bandit. While never being successful or even very deadly he has always been a nuisance. His bandit group named the Jackals has fallen more times than people would care to count, but he always reforms it with young enthusiastic men. It seems that he has a terrible ambition of becoming a bandit of great renown, but instead is more of a figure of bad luck in the region he lives. The greatest feat of banditry the Jackals ever pulled was stealing a merchants wagon and kidnapping the merchant, but he took very little from the wagon and even let the merchant leave with his wagon after a day. As it seems Howard Jackal and his Jackals are just young men wanting the thrill of being bandit. If you ever run into him you are in for a long day, and you might even have a lighter coin-purse</td>

<td>Spike Jackson</td>
<td>Male Human Frontiersman</td>
<td> Spike Jackson is a man who from a young age decided to head out of the kingdom's main land to live his dream of being a frontiersmen. He grew a rugged beard and became incredible at riling up natives in the unexplored region. His goal on this frontier was to make sure that none of the natives would be in sight. He gave a proposition to every group of native species he met, either leave his king's land or die by his sword. Though remarkably hospitable to non-humans and half-bloods he will work with them if they agree in driving out the native population from the land.</td>

<td>Molly Brevas</td>
<td>Female Human Priestess</td>
<td> Molly Brevas is a teenage girl who comes from the slums of the city. Her parents have forced her to spend most of her time at the local church, so she stays away from the crime ridden slum. The resentful of being made to volunteer she remains there cleaning and learning the faith in the church. Answering all requests made towards her with a sigh she continues what she sees as a boring life working in the church. The positive she sees to her volunteer work is that she probably would not be mugged like in other parts of the slums.</td>

<td>Hlevar Silverton</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Silversmith</td>
<td> Hlevar Silverton is a crafts-dwarf that like the rest of his family before him specialize in crafting with silver. Whether it is an ornate jewelry, or making silver arms and armor. Hlevar and the Silvertons before can make silver become whatever their customer requires. Hlevar himself is a dwarf set in his family tradition and refuses any assistance in his craft and preforms it like all his ancestors before him. The biggest change Hlevar brought to Silverton family was moving to the surface and selling his crafts more openly than his family before.</td>

<td>Keruntilogrivex "Runt"</td>
<td>Male goblin peddler, spy, thief</td>
<td> Runt is an aggressively friendly and obsequious traveling goblin merchant. He never travels anywhere without his crammed wagon of merchandise. He has worked long and hard to earn the trust necessary to establish a sales route along the towns and homesteads of the frontier. Along with his legitimate business he operates as the hub of a ring of smugglers and thieves. He's not above murder or thievery, but he chooses his victims very carefully, and hides their bodies even more carefully. As far as anyone can tell, he's just an honest peddler making an honest buck selling honest merchandise.</td>

<td>Raina</td>
<td>Female Elf Bard</td>
<td> Braided long auburn hair, blue eyes, tall and lean, no markings or piercings. Patient with the party to some extent, generally pleasant but ultimately has a hard time fully trusting the group with her needs. Wants to travel the world and capture stories. Is third in line for the elven throne, but has an older brother who she dotes on. He is generally much more sheltered and oblivious. Doesn't drink, doesn't stay up late, doesn't go out much in the evenings, but will accompany the party if asked. Has a soft spot for old people, including old dwarves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Urin</td>
<td>Male Dwarf Merchant</td>
<td> A horribly ugly, yet incredibly cheerful dwarf. Urin has ties to most major factions and a surprising amount of minor factions throughout the lands he travels. He has a thing for Half-Elves, is incredibly clueless when it comes to the significance of his products, (once mistaking an abstract representation of Orcus for an Amulet of Bahamut) and doesn't seem to have much business sense. Oftentimes he'll show his wares in small, poor villages that couldn't hope to afford any of his magic rarities, leading many to wonder if he even needs the coin.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aedonel Redcloak</td>
<td>Male Elf Wizard</td>
<td> An arrogant elven wizard who wishes to demonstrate his arcane prowess to any willing to listen or watch. He travels the world as a performer and mercenary. He doesn't enjoy fighting, but he does covet wealth and arcane power. He is liable to attempt contests of skill with other visibly skilled spellcasters.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Omnibus Omberstien</td>
<td>Female Human Knight</td>
<td> A noble human knight who serves her liege-lord loyally, and often preemptively. She is liable to hunt down potential trouble before it even becomes trouble. This has been known to lead to both accolades and condemnation from the nobility, but her liege-lord has tolerated it so far. She is mildly famous in her home region.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Zonia Ironmoss</td>
<td>Female Dwarven Cleric</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Miss "Manticore" Milesley</td>
<td>Female Halfling Rogue</td>
<td> A notorious halfling thief, she is known for both her peppy, friendly demeanor, and her propensity for effective, brutal violence. She uses a dagger and combat, and always seems to have another up her sleeve. She is wanted in several cites, but definitely has no trouble finding more people to rob.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>John Anderson</td>
<td>Male Human Guard</td>
<td> A relaxed town guard in a small rural town, Anderson is less interested in hunting evil than simply keeping the peace. He is a family man who simply doesn't want any trouble for his town, and is willing to tolerate adventurer-types as long as they spend their gold without causing problems.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Urth</td>
<td>Male Goblin Sorcerer</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Garth</td>
<td>Male Goblin Rogue</td>
<td> Urth's younger brother, what Garth lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sadism. As Urth's right-hand man, he does much of the head-kicking necessary to keep a goblin horde in line. He is feared by all local goblins, and more than a few local humanoids.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Janus Timley</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Barbarian Mobster</td>
<td> Janus is usually a ruthless, efficient, terribly refined mob boss. He puts on airs, and refuses all but the finest in food, wine, and women. He also hides something terrible. The eye of Gruumsh has looked long and hard upon this Half-Orc, leading him to fly into terrifying rages if the wrong buttons are pushed (his heritage, for one thing). He carries a cane, which he uses as a greatclub when he rages.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sharaa Silversword</td>
<td>Female Half-Elf Ranger (Lycanthrope)</td>
<td> Silversword is a famed hunter of monsters whose prowess is famous to local villages and woodsmen. However, she hides the fact that many of her narrow victories are as a result of her lycanthropic curse. The enhanced strength and speed come in handy when fighting the monsters of the forest alone, but she has claimed a terrible number of victims on the way. She wishes she could be cured, but fears for her life too much to mention it to anyone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Percival Aberdeen The Third</td>
<td>Male Gnome War Cleric</td>
<td> Percival hails from a jolly family of gnomish inventors, who he is violently embarrassed by. To him, the greatest joy is to be found on the battlefield, the home of true invention and uncertainty. He is not well known by many (he has left his home far behind), but seeks the thrill of fair contests of warfare wherever he can find it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Skrillex the Enchanter</td>
<td>Male Gnome Enchanter</td>
<td> A kindly elder has a bald head with a long white beard, he's old, hunched, the works. He is a simple enchanter, often granting +1 bonuses or elemental type bonuses to travelers and adventurers. He has nothing to do with Skrillex (the musician) from our world. He gets frustrated anytime adventurers ask him if he "drops the bass" or "enchants people's soul with sound" or other such crap. Often, he'll hike his enchanting prices for people who ask such idiotic questions.</td>

<td>Seran Misherral</td>
<td>Female Elven Commander/Bard</td>
<td> A young slender figure with fair skin and blond hair (as most elves tend to be). She started her life as a bard, traveling from city to city spreading cheer and learning all kinds of valuable information. During <insert war here> she was drafted into the military and lead into combat. Using clever magic and penchant for inspiring troops, she was able to lead a lost and recently leaderless squad fight it's way from behind enemy lines. Quickly she was promoted to real ranks of leadership, of which she rose higher soon enough. As it turns out, being a clever bard is incredibly useful in war-time. You know all kinds of "useless" trivia about your enemy, you better knowing how to think like them, and you have a plethora of unexpected magic tricks up your sleeves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Richard Gavel</td>
<td>Male Half-elf Carpenter</td>
<td> Richard is a younger male working the carpentry trade. He always carries a small red gem shard of some sort. He claims to not carry it for any particular reason, he just thinks it looks kinda cool so he keeps it with him. The one time it got stolen from him, he was kinda miffed, but not particularly upset. It was anonymously returned to him when the would-be thief discovered the gem lacked any real value.</td>

<td>Male Elf Sailor</td>
<td> A young elf in his early hundreds. He was abused and called "old man" by his previous captain and crew. One night, when they stepped off the ship, he used crew supplies and money to hire a crew of his own and set sail. He now goes from city to city hosting "dock parties" whereupon citizens enter the ship to enjoy a good party.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Relic</td>
<td>Male Teifling Guard</td>
<td> Relic works dangerous night patrols, typically preferring to walk the city outer walls or traverse the more shady parts of town. No one knows why he goes by the name 'Relic' and he prefers not to share his real name (though he has admitted to having a different true name than 'Relic'). Locals are familiar and comfortable with Relic's teifling heritage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enpy Seenaim</td>

<td> A retired adventurer, he opened up his own tavern/Inn, the Knife Tip Inn. Stays fit by fighting in the local arena, may be champion there. Motto is "Fight, Drink, Sleep" His surname comes from an old legend his family could preform fire magic without being spellcasters (which may or may not be true).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gopnik Foulstain</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Sewer Worker</td>
<td> Pleasant in demeanor, if not in odour, Gopnik might be the only person keeping the sewer system in Pipe's End from overflowing and fouling up the town. If only there were more strangely long-lived half-orcs with two centuries of plumbing expertise bumping about the sewers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Felegon Blade-of-Dew</td>
<td>Male Eladrin Mercenary</td>
<td> You offer Felegon a place by the fire, but he politely smiles and puts up his hand to refuse. As you inspect the coat, you realize that it isn't drenched in rain; an elaborate illusion makes it constantly appear slick with water. There is a practiced reserve to this seemingly young Eladrin, and you wonder what other illusions he maintains.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hipto Syliloke</td>
<td>Male Gnome Underboss</td>
<td> Hipto giggles, as gnomes are wont to do, but in an unexpectedly gruff tone for one his size. In many ways, Hipto appears to be more dwarven than gnomish, covered in dense fat and coarse hair. His sharp, Feyish features betray his true nature. He tells you he knows where to find your lost companions, but it'll be a hefty fee: Hipto trades only in rare Gnomish artifacts.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chainmaker</td>
<td>Agender Tiefling Vigilante</td>
<td> Nobody took the child seriously, not until they started donning a mask and righting wrongs in the town of Revenant Bay. Chainmaker barely acknowledges your presence, never breaking their solemn vigil. You see their back tense ever so slightly in anticipation as you reveal details about the job. In spite of the somber disguise, there is no masking the reckless enthusiasm of youth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eva Slick</td>
<td>Female Changeling Informant</td>
<td> There is only one way to recognize Eva Slick - a secret known only to those she trusts most closely. Somewhere in her disguises is a small mark of the god Pelor, to whom she has devoted her life after being reformed. You knew her before she was locked up in the Solar Redoubt, and wonder what happened to rob her voice of its original luster and melody.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hansa Vel</td>
<td>Female Human Courtesan</td>
<td> She is not happy to see you here, let alone alive. Like a crimson star, Hansa rose from the alleyways of Karkenbad and into the bedchambers of its Crown Prince, climbing atop the bodies of her closest friends. You would not come to her if it was not completely necessary; there is no better assurance of that fact than the dearth of evidence you have assembled to blackmail her with.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Yoldin Pippernock III</td>
<td>Male Halfling Gentleman Farmer</td>
<td> He saunters over to you, his entire body rolling and undulating. You could swear that, were it not for the hand he kept tight against his belly, Yoldin would simply burst in an eruption of jelly. Grasping his little, sausage fingers in an all-too-wet handshake, the master of Pippernock farms leads you through his famous plantation. The workers defer to this impossibly rotund man, and yet behind the smiles and courtesies is a wasting hunger, fixed pointedly on Yoldin's wrinkled, scrunched-up face.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Felt the Dog</td>
<td>Female Half-Elf Beggar</td>
<td> Nobody seems to remember a time before Felt was Felt. She stumbled into the village, eyes fixed open in a permanent, vacant stare, and began barking and shouting odd, short phrases - things like squirrel, fetch, and bone. Henceforth, she was Felt the Dog, good only for begging and the cruel amusement of others. When she places a paper with the word "HELP" messily scrawled upon it, you look back at her, only to recognize for the first time the alarm in her nearly empty eyes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ennarius Belechonia</td>
<td>Male Elf (Rakshasa) Gentleman</td>
<td> For a gentleman, Ennarius seems to have an oddly difficult time manipulating cutlery and working doorknobs. Regardless, you cannot help but feel warm and alive in his presence - generous, kind, and altogether lovely chap. Only time you've seen him thrown off kilter is when someone mentions his income, which is a closely guarded secret. He only ever mentions the mines he operates, for which he recruits when in town.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rosaria Bone-Break-Crunch</td>
<td>Female Minotaur Scholar</td>
<td> A man walks into the library, and minutes later comes running out, screaming. You ready your sword and burst in, to find a massive, bull-headed woman sitting quietly, flipping through the pages of a book. She looks at your sword and rolls her eyes, droning out her monotone welcome speech for those visiting the Greenlake Academy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Leona Fleetskin</td>
<td>Female, Changeling, Prostitute</td>
<td> Well, here's my contribution! Might not be the best, but these are all off the top of my head so keep that in mind when you giggle at them. More Barbarian than Wizard, Krug has only the slightest touch of magic about him but desperately seeks to associate himself with civilized Wizards and Sorcerers. He travels from place to place telling fortunes for a pittance. He does this by gargling a bag of runes covered in Draconic script and spitting them one by one into a bowl then reading the future based on the way they land. These fortunes are very specific but usually about totally insignificant things like the hair colour of the next person you're going to meet or how many trees you'll see tomorrow. A handsome and charming middle aged man. Lon jokes that he obtained his name due to the combination of his dark complexion and good luck in games of chance. In reality he uses several enchanted items of clothing and jewellery to draw in and swindle the patrons of small town taverns, big city bars and everywhere in between. A 16 year old Changeling girl making the most out of her natural shape changing abilities and avoiding the mistrust most people have of her people. Leona has set herself up in the identity of a powerful Sorceress fallen on hard times. Using her "magic" to take the form of anyone her customers bring a detailed enough picture of/introduce her to. A massive step up from her humble beginnings as a street urchin Leona is enjoying the status her money has brought her and spends recklessly on anything shiny and pretty enough. However, despite this shallowness she secretly donates large sums to the church she and the other homeless children used to sleep in during the harsh winters.</td>

He's willing to barter his wares for catnip if the PCs figure out that he's got a substance abuse problem. Has a collection of magical balls of yarn. Sells survival supplies like a ranger or rogue would use, including traps. He's got a basement in his shop that's protected by the very traps he sells.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Scoggin Longmore</td>
<td>Male Satyr Musician/Bard</td>
<td> Travels from town to town. He is a lore expert about most everything though it wouldn't seem like it to look at him. He's introverted, except when it's performance time. He sings songs about things that couldn't possibly have happened though a sense motive check shows he's usually telling the truth. Has a magical set of panpipes. He runs at the first sign of trouble.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dr. Aveneros Charles Ula</td>
<td>Male Eladrin Vampire Magus</td>
<td> He's an avid art collector and despite being a total recluse, cannot resist following up on rumors of new artwork in town. He's charming, well-dressed, and aristocratic. Not the least bit pretentious. His appearance does not suggest that he's a vampire. Once a year, he hosts a gala for the territory's elite in order to show off his collection. He sometimes considers strange and rare creatures for his collection. He's on a 123-year mission to bring his wife back from permanent death. His castle contains an immense library of knowledge about the planes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Callidus The Bold</td>
<td>Male Human Wizard</td>
<td> Callidus created an underground sanctuary for a group of people needing to escape a cataclysmic event several millennia ago. He had planned on only needing to use the sanctuary for 20 years, but was instead locked away by his own mistake for much longer. He's gone cookoo crazy and is only alive because of a ring of sustenance and a time dilation spell cast on the sanctuary. He has a hard time believing that the outside is safe but is willing to help the players with anything they want if they successfully convince him to leave.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jarrell Blacksteel</td>
<td>Male Human Blacksmith</td>
<td> A gruff blacksmith, married to a sorceress. He is often found gnawing on strips of metal and has a somewhat arrogant demeanor. Once you get to know him he can be quite likeable, even though he is supremely confident in his blacksmithing skills to the point of annoyance to others.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mariel Blacksteel</td>
<td>Female Human Enchantress</td>
<td> Married to a blacksmith named Jarrell, she handles the enchanting part of the business. Very friendly and charming, she makes sure her customers don't get turned away by her husband's attitude. Her favorite part of the job is testing young sorcerers by selling them magical items they can't quite handle yet to see what happens. Sometimes the results are disastrous, but she doesn't seem to mind.</td>

<td>Lord Vaskeron</td>
<td>Half-elf Male Noble</td>
<td> He had a pampered childhood, but it didn't last very long. After his family fell from grace he worked long and hard to get back where he belongs. Nowadays he is an influential man and he and his family are back to their old status. He is very much concerned with appearances. Occasionally, he performs a 'good deed', but he does those things for acknowledgement and attention only, not out of the goodness of his heart. He enjoys parties and spicy sausages.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Anastasia</td>
<td>Dhampir Female Adventurer</td>
<td> Obsessed by knowledge, she has gone to great lengths to acquire ancient relics and artifacts. She will hire fellow adventurers to help her get what she wants, and discard them once she is done, unless they are genuinely interesting people (in her eyes). Few academics rival her practical knowledge on matters dungeoneering-related and she can take care of herself in a pinch.</td>

Took a chunk of shrapnel to the back of the leg and hasn't been able to walk right since. In his 60s, with shock-white hair and a blunt attitude.

He always has some sort of work for the party with a cut of the pay of course for all the legwork he does. Speaking of legwork, no one has ever confirmed to have seen Bartenderson's legs.

<td>Loren</td>
<td>Middle aged male farmer</td>
<td> An alcoholic, Sleds has worked on a steadily less and less impressive list of ships. Currently unemployed after being put to shore by his last crew for excessive drunkenness while on duty, he's in whatever port city you choose unwillingly. Not a penny to his name, but somehow finds a way to come up with enough cash for the next drink. Got his name after a drunken dare led him to take a ride down the main street on an empty cask of beer during a particularly muddy and rainy night. He wound up losing control rather predictably and smashed into a patrol of the town guard. Two guardsmen wound up with broken bones and he earned himself a week in a jail cell. The name stuck. Loren is a bitter man who looks older than his 45 years. A sour personality brought on in part by a lifelong grudge against his parents for giving him what he feels is a woman's name, he holds a grudge against his wife as well who named his daughter after him when she gave birth while he was in town on an errand. Very much a beta, he's the type to grumble to himself and talk a big game, but when it comes to confrontation he's the first to back down and cower. With only a few stained teeth to his name, he chews tobacco or whatever similar thing exists in your world, but would never touch alcohol and judges those who do rather harshly--but quietly and privately.</td>

Catherine grew up on the streets of the overland. She was often bullied, being the only drow around. She didn't put up with it though, plotting revenge. She was careful in her spite, and figured the best way to get back at her bullies would be to turn them against each other. She would "relocate" things. Things that would go mostly unnoticed, and turn up in places they would be found. Her craft eventually wound her up in jail, where she would talk with other inmates. She learned the craft of lock picking, and her own natural ingenuity and perhaps a lack of self control led her to breaking out. Word got around. Mainly amongst other thrives and criminals. Her skillfully quick and careful hands managed to attract employers. Not soon after, she found herself working for the thieves guild.

Tons of other fighters come around to throw fists in bars, and so far, she can brag king and queen, beating any challenger of any race that has come her way. Her strength is help, but her wit backs it up tenfold. From using bottles to trip opponents to ripping off loin clothes and slamming them in their embarrassment.

She made the promise to her dad, his dying wishes to be for her, and her next of kin, to watch over the temple. The only problem that Marry faced, was that she was infertile. In a fit of hysteria, Marry began to research necrotic arcana in order to build her phylactery; a small statue of Ehlonna made of gold, deep inside the temple. She has only recently died, her skin is still fairly neat and her eyes not rotten away too much. At first glance, she may even appear normal.

She eats people because she learned an immortality rite from a forbidden book that involves cannibalism and blood sacrifices to her true god.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thenmozhibe</td>
<td>Female tiefling moneylender</td>
<td> Relatively tall with a wiry build, and no noticeable hair. Carries a many-notched steel staff of exactly five feet that she uses for taking measurements. Spends a month at a time inspecting roads and bridges and recommending changes around a town that hires her before moving on. Understands several languages but primarily speaks Dwarven in conversations with herself and others. His nose makes a faint whistling noise when he talks. Spends his evenings cleaning tables at a friend's inn in exchange for a room. Average height, broad shoulders, and shaved head with a large greying mustache. Has substantial savings that he intends to put toward building a house in the woods nearby. Twice married to human men less than half her age and twice widowed from duels in her honor. Wears secondhand clothes and jewelry from whichever town she last visited, to be traded in or sold for replacements in her current town. Talented flutist who takes pride in recognizing and developing the musical talents of those around her. Long brown hair, green eyes, and a permanently seductive expression. Dull-witted but friendly, and loyal to his friends and employers (in that order). Unable to speak any language except rudimentary Dwarven, though he understands orders as long as they are in Dwarven. His face is a misshapen mess of scars and broken bones that he has accumulated over the years, and his unkempt red beard has had chunks torn out of it. He is independently wealthy and spends coin generously, though nobody knows where or how he has amassed such a fortune. Short brown hair, a hawkish nose, and a large pair of canine teeth jutting up from her lower jaw make up an unusual visage, if not a particularly ugly one. She does not boast many clients, but those that pay will pay very well for her services - and highly recommend "that thing she does with her teeth." Offers a money-back guarantee if clients leave unsatisfied, which no one has yet been able (or willing) to claim. Spends most of her free time passing by the homes of the nobility, admiring their gardens. Straight black horns follow his thin white hair back behind his head; rheumy brown eyes sit above a thin-lipped business smile. A team of apprentices run the day-to-day operations while he sits in the back of his shop, dreaming up and sketching fashion ideas. When a client of sufficient value enters, he becomes as authoritative and demanding as any tyrant, and will often simply forbid a troublesome client from speaking altogether; it is a testament to his prowess that business does not waver. He holidays with his paramour among the nobility once each year, whose identity he keeps secret largely for his own sake. Standing six feet even, Sash is heavily muscled and deceptively quick; her hair is tied back and she has silver tattoos over her arms and legs that stand out in stark contrast to her ebony skin. She's a bouncer for a tavern that sees very little business during the day, but much more when she's managing the tavern's fight pit after midnight. She regularly takes a week off to visit her family out of town, though once in a blue moon she'll take one of her many challengers up on their offer for a fight in the pit. Her tattoos are in Orcish - what she thinks says "Swiftness," "Vengeance," "Fury," and "Resolve" actually says "Fruit," "Southeast," "Brownly," and "Dwwabmmh." Soft white scales run from the crown of his head and flare out all the way down his spine, while the rest of him covered in smooth, leathery grey skin. At his full height, he is a scale under six feet tall, with the tendency to crouch or bow his head to better hear those smaller than him. While young for his kind, he is very sickly; on any given day he might be sweating or coughing heavily, and he usually sounds exhausted. On rare occasions (months apart), he feels genuinely, truly good for days at a time, during which he shuts himself in his tiny home and works non-stop as his cultured colleagues await the results with baited breath. Short and stocky frame, with asymmetrical, broken brown horns that have been filed smooth. She can be very abrasive, and speaks openly about her distaste for her clients, her hired thugs, and the business of moneylending. She balks at spending money herself, though she is quick to jump on a deal if she's certain she can turn it over in her favor quickly. She refuses to deal in silver pieces, in an often futile attempt to invoke her demonic heritage for leverage.</td>

<td>Lana of the Riverlands</td>
<td>Female Watergenasi Hermit/Druid</td>
<td> A weird old woman that lives in a small hole by the riverside. She takes care of the ecosytem of the riverland around where the river Vree flows into the Great Green Sea. She sees herself as the guardian of the river, having lived here for almost 40 years. She avoid human contact most of the time but some days she visits the town of Vreedam, where she tends to the sick and poor. Most of the normal citizens of Vreedam see her as a harmless nutter, but to the homeless, beggars and orphants she is seen as a kind of saint. Whenever she goes throught the streets there is allways a swarm or urchins surrounding her and she allways has some goodberries to spare. Her hair has turned the colour of sea foam and her sky blue skin has as many wrinkels as the sea during a storm, her back isn't what it used to be either so she is seldom seen without the driftwood staff she uses for walking. But her eyes are still the same as in her youth. Big eyes that catch the light and reflect it like a mountain lake on a windless day. Yet also deep and blue like the sea. Eyes that you could loose yourself in and drown. And many a man did back in the days. The old folk can sometimes tell of a time where every man was trying to court the mysterious lady of the shore. Yet none succeded. None but one.</td>

<td>Kareem the Bright, Captain of the Ocean Dawn/Bard</td>
<td>Male Fire Genassi Captain of a trading ship</td>
<td> When he first arrived in Vreedam the news spread like wildfire, soon every young womans heart was burning with a passion. He was handsome, he was charming, he was exotic. In one word, he was hot. The Ocean Dawn hailed from Brangha, a big trading city in the far west. She was carring fruit, spices and silk of sorts people in Vreedam had never seen. The Ocean Dawn stayed in harbour for 3 weeks. Quite a long time. Why you ask? To celebrate the Dawns arrival the major decided to hold a massive party, it doesn't happen every day (or even year) that a ship from this far west found it's way to Vreedam after all. There was music and dance, food and alcohol, laughter and cheering. And at the center of it all was Kareem. Allways surounded by a flock of young woman, first dancing with this one, then with that one. Then he was gone. As if by magic. Which in a magic rich world like this seems actually quite likely ;) You see Kareem isn't actually quite the party type, while he loves to dance he doesn't like big crowds. He is honestly a bit of a loner. And so it came that on this fatefull night an again visible Kareem decided to take a stroll along the beach. And it was here, where the Vree joins the Great Green Sea that he met her. Deep Blue hair blowing in the ocean breeze, looking out towards the sea with eyes that reflected the moon and the stars. Their eyes met and Kareem could feel his heart skip a beat. The next day some folk reported seeing two figures dancing on the waves, only their silhouettes visible against the morning sun rising from the ocean. The Ocean Dawn left 3 weeks later, to travel to the Small Green Sea and sell the rest of it's wares and return a few weeks later to Vreedom to let of a single person and then travel back west to Brangha where it would have to find a new captain. This was the last anyone saw of the Oceans Dawn for 35 years.</td>

Jasper grew up on the streets of Vreedam, a town that doesn't do much for it's homeless and orphants. He is good friends with Lana of the Riverlands. During some especially hard times the goodberries she gives to the orphans were the only food he had for weeks. He considers this a lifelong depth he owes her. He left the town with 16 with little more then the shirt on his back. He returned 3 years later, wearing fine clothes and carrying a purse full of goldcoins. Some foul mouths would tell you that the ways he got this money weren't quite legal. They are right. Jasper dreams of marrying the mayors daughter Anika Hummel and opening an orphanage in Vreedam. And he is allready making progress towards these dreams. Well at least the first one.</td>

Unbeknown to everyone she and Jasper have been seeing each other for a few months now. Meeting in secret. She knows that her father would not aprove of her relationship woth Jasper, her mother might.

Hugo has been the mayor of Vreedam for the last 25 years and has actually done a quite decent job. Since he became mayor the town has seen a stready grow in population and prosperity, trade has been good and the depth that the old mayor managed to create has been payed of in full. (The old mayor was fond of throwing parties for various ocasions using town money.) The Hummels have been a merchant family in Vreedam since its inception 300 years ago. They used to own the very first corner store. Where it stood before now stands the Hummel Trade hall, which hosts most of the trade going on in Vreedam. Hugo is very proud about Vreedam and the development it has seen during his time. Whenever talking about it he has taken to calling it the City of Vreedam thought nobody else has adopted this yet. He is the father of Anika Hummel, husband of Natalia Hummel and big brother of Henry Hummel.</td>

They were what some might call fools in love. Sadly over the years the fire of passion faded and their mariage is hardly what you could call passionate.

You will usually find him either in the hall or at the harbour speaking to some merchant or the captain of a trading ship in their native language. Few people know that he actaully owes this gift for languages to a magic ring of languages that allows it's wearer to read any language and speak to people in any language they know. The ring has been a family heirloom for generations and its origins are said to be of not quite holy nature. (It was demons, some ancestor sold his soul for this ring) Henry is also the biological father of Anika. A fact only him and Natalia know.</td>

</tr><tr>

</tr><tr>

<td>Male Dwarf Bard</td>
<td> Taller than average for a dwarf with light brown hair & beard. Deep, raspy voice that sings of loss, love, & the places those two have met. His height made him an oddball amoung his dwarven home & he hit the road to see the world.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Gorb</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Politician</td>

<td>Male Dwarf Captain of the guard</td>
<td> Harmin is a fierce fighter and will send himself to the death to protect those in his care. He uses an enormous greataxe. However, he prefers to defend than to attack, and is in favour of walling people in to take care of them better. He is extremely untrusting, but extremely trustworthy.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Semaphora Underwood</td>
<td>Female Halfling Baker's Apprentice</td>
<td> Semaphora wants so badly to be a sexual deviant, but she has the worst luck with it. She's got a thing for beards, but that just nets her gay dwarves and bearded ladies. She will go to absurd lengths and always fail stupidly.</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>Male half-elf painter</td>
<td> The son of the butcher, Herb loves to paint, and is very good at it. He gained the skill and passion from his father, but is often told to get back to work on something that will put food on the table, which, when you work as a butcher, is very literal. He paints wherever and whenever he can, out of his father's gaze.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Baldrick Fancyson</td>
<td>Male Human Innkeeper</td>
<td> Baldrick is a human who looks like a short, wide dwarf, down to the beard. He uses stilts when behind the bar. His big bar idea was to cater to the merchant wagons that pass through the city, and he has enormous, well-supplied stables to this effect.

</tr><tr>
<td>Belinda Stoneworth</td>
<td>Female Dwarf City Guard</td>
<td> Working for the guard was not Belinda's first choice of career but her lack of physical fitness prevented her from joining the standing army.

Despite this, she is a model guard.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Roderick Nestfellow</td>
<td>Male Gnome Barber</td>
<td> Roderick has been a barber for the last 40 years and loves his work with a fanatical zeal. His customers are very regular and are happy to come in for a good shave and a better conversation.

</tr><tr>
<td>The Storm</td>
<td>Male Half-elf Sorcerer</td>
<td> "The Storm" is unlikely to reveal his true name. He's young, but not quite young enough to justify wearing all black, being very angsty, and referring to himself in the third-person by a superhero-esque monicker. He makes every attempt to remain mysterious but often breaks the illusion by grumbling about his parents. He is a surprisingly skilled magic-user.</td>
</tr><tr>

With a faint accent, one of his family's twin ancestral swords, and a spring in his step, he jaunts from city to city. Many fans of his are eager to throw parties in his name, an honor he doesn't seem to mind. However, his family back home, specifically his brother, the lord of the island, are none too happy that Veylin took one of the ancestral swords that are rightfully his, and left the line of succession to go off on what is (in their eyes) quite a silly occupation.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pallen "Silvertongue"</td>
<td>Male Halfling Gang Leader</td>
<td> Those who see Pallen for the first time assume him to be a perfectly nice man. Why, he would never hurt a fly. However, those unlucky tavern owners and innkeepers who live in the same neighborhood as him know him as a ruthless man who will do anything for money and power, and half the inns and taverns owe him protection money. But most just see his friendly exterior, a happy face, an easy smile and the famous sharp tongue that gives him his nickname and pass him on by.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stalwart</td>
<td>??? Warforged Butler</td>
<td> Stalwart is the longtime manservant and butler of a high-ranking lord of a noble family. The one thing that separates him from most of his brethren is his remarkably sharp tongue and cynical and sarcastic sense of humor. No one knows quite how a member of this normally humorless race developed such a wit, but it is clear that his sense of humor is quite developed, often surpassing the wit of his employer. Many fellow nobles call on the employer just to hear what Stalwart mutters under his breath, and several family friends think of Stalwart in as high if not higher regards as they do the actual family.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Adaliah</td>
<td>Female Spirit Caretaker</td>
<td> She is an emissary of the deities, most often associated with those of the realms of life and death as she assists the souls of those traveling from the material world. She may often be seen by the bedside of those who die alone. Her other favorite spots are park benches watching children play or chatting with strangers.

</tr><tr>
<td>George, the Gregarious</td>
<td>Male Human Cleric</td>
<td> A towering, portly, middle-aged man with a red face, a beard to rival most dwarves, and sausage fingers. George prefers simple robes to armor as he is often seen with a barrel of ale on his back, a stein in his hand (that mysteriously never empties), and his two handed mace that functions more as a glorified walking stick. If the rumors are to be believed, several orc tribes, an arch-demon, a lich, 2 chromatic dragons, and a vampire coven all have on separate occasions halted their plans and entertained guests simply because George's name was mentioned.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Peabody the Strongman</td>
<td>Male Half-Orc Personal Trainer</td>
<td> "Even for adventurer like you staying in shape hard work. When you make up mind to get strong, Peabody will be there. Like ravenous displacer beast, Peabody will pounce to make you run faster. Peabody will surprise you in sleep for 50 night-pushups. Me work hard so you work hard!"</td>

He dreams of leading an army back to his fractured, human-run homeland from where he was exiled.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fetch</td>
<td>Goblin. Male. Abomination.</td>
<td> Once a proud tribe leader, he has had his strength, his memories, and even his name stripped from him. A wizard wiped out his tribe, but needed a servant - he took the broken body of Fetch, and made him into a half-magic, half-goblin abomination. Is replenished and strengthened by being hit with any type of spell - that doesn't make it hurt any less, however. Has escaped his former master, and now lurks in dark forests, preying upon hapless travelers - in a very literal way.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Harold Von Talsken</td>
<td>Male Wizard (High Level) Dwarf</td>
<td> This wizard speaks with a very thick german accent to differentiate himself from his more scottish speaking poor people. He constantly complains about his greatest invention, made to sound as an actual physical magical artifact, being stolen by Llib Setag a human wizard, when pressed on this his invention it turns it out it was nothing but an idea, but it was stolen nonetheless because he can no longer remember what it was.

</tr><tr>
<td>Ishmere Elehan</td>
<td>Elf Female Bard</td>
<td> A bard by trade, a pickpocket by night, an occasional turtledove. She can be found in the wealthier parts of town, usually sweet talking the guards to be allowed to "busk" in those districts.

</tr><tr>
<td>Xume Dalagom</td>
<td>Female Drow Cleric</td>
<td> At a glance, you can tell she's grown up in spiritual community, by her short white mohawk haircut and modest-looking black robe. At young age, she was chosen by Milil, and exiled from Drow society because of that. She prefers physical solution to her problems over magical ones, since she's a drow. She usually hangs out with bards, minstrels and artists, at local theaters and libraries.</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>Male Ghostwise Halfling Monk</td>
<td> Back when Grimey was young, his father went travelling into world, telling him stories about a huge treasure he was going to find to make his family back in Shoun live a happy life.

</tr><tr>
<td>Jens Folkhard</td>
<td>Male Lightfoot Halfling Warlock</td>
<td> Ashamed of not being able to keep up with traditions in their community of Ghostwise halflings, he contacted the Great Cthulhu and begged him for his powers. The Great Cthulhu gave him powers, in return for the rest of his life being his pawn in his great return. From time to time, he is asked to do seemingly ridiculous things that supposedly help in the summoning. Little does he know, the things he does today will have effects in the future - some in the closer future, some in further one.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aiwin Galanodel</td>
<td>Male Wood Elf Mentor</td>
<td> Four dots in shape of a letter Y on his forehead, the short black hair and the charismatic voice. Many people recognize him as the mentor of monks, who left monastery long time ago to spread his word through the world. He cares about his students, and always seeks for more. His secret hope is that one day, he will start his own monastery with his new philosophic views of the world.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mansel North</td>
<td>Male Human Sailor</td>
<td> When boarding the Red Sunset ship, you couldn't miss this tall pale human with athletic build and no hair on his head.

He is too quiet - he doesn't say anything unless asked to.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Arno Bearkiller Kalukolake</td>
<td>Male Goliath Adventurer</td>
<td> Muscular goliath that stomps with each step, yet can move swiftly. He proved his adulthood by slaying Skrämbeorn, the great bear that terrorized villagers.

</tr><tr>
<td>Riva</td>
<td>Female Drow Paladin</td>
<td> She grew up to become a paladin loyal to her kind. Long white hair and dark skin may be classic features of a drow, but what could throw you off is lack of fascination for spiders. She's cold, shy and catious, but also inquisitive about the faith of others, but can tolerate paladins and clerics of other faiths. She talks in sleep about her drow friends she hasn't seen in years and is fascinated by birds.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Maggi Swampbottom</td>
<td>Female (Human...?) Vender</td>
<td> A old, absurdly hairy woman, with grey hair covering her entire body, giving her a sense of mystery. Sells many magical items in her small indestructible wood hut, which can teleport to various locations (such as when PCs enter the town/city).
