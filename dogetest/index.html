<h1>A descent into madness with dogescript</h1>

<p>A while ago, I ventured into the journey of "how do i get dogescript to run in the browser", which was madness but at the end I was able to have something that runs dogescript "natively". This page is just a repository of other different sample pages that already work with dogescript. To learn more about each one, check out the readme</p>
<a href="./README.md">README</a>

<ul>
<li><a href="/dogetest/basedogescript/">basedogescript</a>: a basic setup for running some dogescript and evaluating it to javascript</li>
<li><a href="/dogetest/filedogescript/">filedogescript</a> basic setup for using brfs/browserify to load a local resource with some dogescript</li>
<li><a href="/dogetest/tagdogescript/">tagdogescript</a> setup for running code inside script tags with a type="text/dogescript", tags with src will not work locally</li>
<li><a href="/dogetest/rundogescript/">rundogescript</a> a rehash of the old example page, with dogescript on the left and javascript on the right, as well as a run button</li>
</ul>

<p> every file will also load a dogerunner function that you can use in the chrome console</p>
<pre>
// define a global function that can run text dogescript
dogerunner = function(ds)
{
  eval(dogescript(ds));
}
</pre>

<p>Feel free to try this out with 
dogerunner("plz alert with 'much doge'"); , this page will also have that loaded for you :)</p>
