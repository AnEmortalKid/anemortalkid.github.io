# dogetest

Dogetest is a descent into the madness of [dogescript](https://github.com/dogescript/dogescript/). 

As I attempted to get a page to run dogescript "natively", and by natively I mean just either:
* a script tag with dogescript ran through dogescript.parse and then through eval
* a script tag with src pointing to dogescript
* or loading a .djs file and running that

I ended up descending into the crazyness that is webpack,browserify and all that jazz.

However, the index.html page that you see in this repo is the finished playground of getting something to run.


# instructions

1. Get NPM if you don't have it, you can find that guy [here](https://www.npmjs.com/) since most of the things you'll need get installed with node.
2. Get [dogescript](https://github.com/dogescript/dogescript/) which you will install with npm (globally using the -g flag)
`npm install -g dogescript`
3. 



## samples

The following folders contain enough javascript/html to just load the sample in a page and nothing fancy.
