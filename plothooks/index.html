<td>The Hand of [Enter PC Name Here]</td>
<td> The players learn that undead have been terrorizing a nearby town lately and the culprit is likely residing in the abandoned tomb close by. The players encounter some undead (zombie dogs, mummies, etc.) while traversing the tomb but all they find out is that a lich likely resided there long ago. During the trek, however, one of the players gets bit by a wight and becomes plagued with an affliction. Have a local cleric stop the affliction from spreading, but now the PC's hand is changed forever. Give it some utility features (a minor and major advantage/disadvantage), and continue the story. Unbeknownst to the PCs, the cleric is the culprit and has been secretly researching and practicing necromancy in the tomb. At some point later in the story, have the cleric be revealed as a minor/major BBEG who became obsessed with his research and is after the PCs hand. If you want to increase the stakes, have the removal of the hand cause instant death/drop to zero HP and roll death save, and/or have the cleric confront the PCs because he can take control of the PC.</td>

Plot twist: even though she keeps saying that an era of fire would bring life, light and warmth to the material plane the truth is that no element ever wins the convergence and this is what keeps the material plane balanced. If an element gets an edge over the others terrible things happens on the material plane (a fire era would more likely bring firestorms, heat the planet and start a vulcanic apocalypse).</td>

Unbeknownst to the party though, a clutch of young mimics live in the area, and have learned the neat trick of looking like a hat causes people to pick you up and put you on their heads so you can then proceed to bite their heads off.

A local wizard is interested in the truth. A bishop from a long forgotten city has appeared in the history records at a bards college. Legend tells of it'd magnificent beauty, and hints at its magical prowess. It seems that after the bishop received the ring from the "One True God", he was able to communicate directly with the diety.

Statues or images of their god start to corrode, rot or crumble away. The signs and portents of their spells change. Instead of ravens as messenger spirits, bats. Instead of green flames, blue. Eventually, the PCs learn that somehow this god has been killed and replaced. An epic-level adventurer climbed the difficult path to the heavens and usurped this deity.

No matter which way they say they're going, the troupe says they're headed in that direction as well, and could they travel with the party as they're feeling a little nervous since the mercs they were paying to guard them, betrayed them instead and ran off with the troupe's money. Even if the party refuses them, the troupe will follow them closely, when confronted, they will admit that they're scared the mercs might come back and finish them off, or some other menace might get them. So, by staying close to the party, they hope things will be scared off. That night, while the party sleeps, the party member(s) on guard will find themselves suddenly attacked with a concerted barrage of mesmerize, charm, sleep, or other mind affecting spells. It turns out that the wandering troupe is actually a traveling group of Were-rats, who do this regularly to adventuring parties, caravans, merc companies, etc. Can the party survive the were-rats treachery? Alternatively, if your players are too suspicious of the troupe, you could change it so they really are a minstrel troupe that has been treated badly by a merc company, and that merc company is coming back that night while the groups are camped to finish the job. Let them get all fearful of the troupe, and then surprise them with the mercs instead.</td>

<td>But really, what's the difference between necromancy and resurrection?</td>
<td> First post wasn't on topic, so I'm back for more: Of course, not all resurrections are made equal. Sometimes the plant reagents have gone bad, or the wrong ones were picked. Sometimes the person had been dead for too long. And sometimes, like this time for instance, part of the characters soul was invaded by a parasite upon reentry into the physical world. Slowly, she loses the spark of life. She can still move, still talk, and is as strong as ever, but her voice has gone flat and her appetite has disappeared. At first you thought it was some sort of depression, but then last night happened. Out of the blue, her magic stopped working. The high counsel of wizards suggest you kill her again, and capture the soul as it leaves her body. This way, you can separate host from parasite, but of course, this is a dangerous, and risky process. And hasn't been tried for many centuries. Books will need to be dug up from ancient tombs, and long lost reagents found. This'll be a long one, but your characters very soul is at stake. Better act fast before there's nothing left! Well, it turns out it depends on the diety. Some are more than happy to oblige, but others, the darker gods, want to keep what's theirs. And they punish those who would try to steal from them. And this one happens to do so by raising the dead. If you can take what's his, he can take what's yours. Since birth, you were told you were the chosen one. The ultimate mover and shaker of the centuries. Only - now you've lost your one-ness. It seems that you've been possessed, and this creature, this seed, this thing inside of your mind, digging and burying itself further inside of your consciousness, thinks that you're not the chosen one. It is. You find yourself acting in your sleep, unable to remember what you've done. Sometimes it takes over during the day, and you can't come close to fighting its power. It acts in ways you would never imagine, and seems to be planning something against your will. It pushes you to accept quests, and reject others. All with one thing in common: blood magic. Resurrections aren't easy you know. They're expensive, and a time consuming process. And it doesn't always work. But you've heard tell of a cheaper way, Cloning. A wild outcast of a tinkering gnome thinks he's found a way to clone living tissue. All he needs is a spell which will extract the memories from a living being. Such a shame that the only wizard who knows of such things is evil, and living at the top of a tower a long, long way south. That's what Elbert asked himself while studying his ancient tombs over 40 years ago. "Isn't necromancy giving life to what is already dead? And shouldn't they do what I bid? I was the one giving them life. I was the one who put purpose back into their cold and rotting corpses. It's a small cost to pay, and I'll free them eventually! All I have to do is find a way..." Or so he told himself. 40 years later, and he's hidden himself away in the catacombs, surrounded by the dead, and all alone. He believes that he can fracture the soul of a living person, and give it to the undead. Little does he know, he's making a lich that MUST be stopped.</td>

<td>Robbed, then Framed</td>
<td> Inside a busy town, the party is robbed by a passing vandal. Following a small chase scene, detailed with the typical cart dodging and stall vaulting, the party will catch the thief in some dead end alleyway. Palms up, swearing no trickery, the thief will return the party's stolen belongings. The thief will also helpfully forfeit some of his other stolen wares as well. Returning to the market place, a well armed group of guards will stop our merry band of adventurers. "In the King's name, your are charged with breaking into the high vault of the Royal Treasury. Stand down, criminal scum, and accept your punishment - death!"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Royal Getaway</td>
<td> The Prince/Princess has never left the extent of his/her kingdom, and is interested in learning about the faraway lands detailed in his/her history books. Of course, the King and Queen hardly want to see their precious child runaway into certain danger. The Royal Child is offering an ample sum for the party to take the prince/princess as an additional member of the party. Be warned, however, should the Child encounter any danger and not return unharmed, the wrath of the Kingdom will fall against our fair adventurers.</td>

<td>Pirate Band</td>
<td> Sailing throughout the Seven Seas, there lies pirate band, pillaging all that they please. The watch has been called, a bounty is set, the whole kingdom moves to oppose threat. Yet, fair adventures, know this to be true! Beware of their captain, else he'll run you through! A bard of wicked rhythm, a rapscallion musician; He'll crush any pirate hunter's foolish ambition!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Funny Thing Happened on the Quay by the Forum</td>
<td> A merchant from a distant city has arrived, swathed in acres of silk, and has managed to simultaneously undercut and outprofit nearly every fishmonger on the quay, seemingly overnight. No self-respecting angler will admit to selling fish to the foreigner, and the local guild is considering artificially inflating the price of seafood so that other merchants can compete. More troubling, several of the waterfront's resident urchins/couriers/pickpockets have gone missing, and reports of dark shapes in the water have caused the watch to establish ban on swimming.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>All's Quiet on the Warlock Front</td>
<td> The sudden reappearance of the Warlock Prince after almost twenty years abroad has the arcane networks abuzz, and hedge wizards, hermit sorcerers and socialite bards alike have been invited to attend the ceremonial recrowning. Conspicuously left out? Your (wizard/warlock/sorcerer/bard/cleric).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ravenloft and Greyhawk are Dead</td>
<td> Simultaneously, every creature in every facet of existence hears the same plea - "The Planes are Dying! Woe! The Planes are Dying!" - followed by an empathetic barrage of every emotion conceivable. It's over almost before it started, and only a select few are able to stop gibbering for long enough to parse the meaning of the message.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A song to follow</td>
<td> After a long day on the road, the party settles in a small, lively inn. As soon as the party's bard starts playing (or, if the party lacks one, the local fiddler), a beautiful, yet eerie woman starts singing strange lyrics to the melody that describe a way through the local country side to an abandoned house and end with the words: "Party Face's Name found the lone hound's hall / and recognized it well / and by the very last breath's call / they ended the demon's spell". The mysterious singer cannot remember anything, but will repeat the words when the tune is played again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mirror Image</td>
<td> A covered mirror, found the by the party, turns out to be magic. It shows a glimpse of the future (based on the character's background) by altering the appearance of whatever is reflected in the mirror (this can be the appearance of the character including physical features or clothing/equipment, or the surrounding location). Characters roll a d20 to determine how good or bad what they see is (the lower the roll, the worse, and the higher, the better). At the end of their vision, a second d20 is rolled to determine if something they saw (such as a scar, wound, armor, or location effect like a building behind them being on fire) is permanent in the real world (10 or lower, something is permanent, 5 or lower ensures it is something bad, a critical 1 requires it to be a serious injury, and a critical 20 provides a powerful boon). One character sees a vision of himself shattering the mirror. Any attempt to shatter the mirror fails - it cannot be broken by any standard means.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Kitchen Nightmare</td>
<td> The city is abuzz, as word has spread that a great and world famous chef, Riordan Gamsy, has come to the city and will be cooking a meal for the king. But, in order to cook this exquisite meal, he will need exclusive and rare ingredients procured for him, and sure enough the kingdom hires the PCs to acquire said ingredients. The list is full of hard to obtain ingredients, such as a moss that only grows on the bodies of zombies, and the meat of a Bullette, etc., you get the point. But, after gathering all these ingredients, and bring them to Chef Gamsy, he has to admit to the PCs that he doesn't actually know how to cook very well. He's a con man who just kind of stumbled into this gig of being a world famous chef. He makes lists of ingredients that he knows no one in their right mind would ever gather, and lives off the generosity of the king/queen/etc. while waiting for the ingredients to be procured, and then when they fail to procure the ingredients, he gets huffy, says he will not compromise his art, and then moves off to the next kingdom. No one has ever been able to get all the ingredients before, and he doesn't know what to do now, as this lord will actually be expecting him to create a mind-blowing meal with the ingredients the party has gotten. First he'll beg the party for help, but if they refuse he'll threaten the party, saying that if they don't help them with his situation he'll tell the lord that they were in on the scam as well, and they'll all go to the chopping block together. What does the party do?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Friend of the Family</td>
<td> A stranger comes-a-calling, and requests to speak with the PC's late great relative of some kind. PC explains that relative has been dead but you recall hearing stories of Aunt/Uncle stranger name, yet they look as though they haven't aged a day. The stranger is struck with WoE for with as many years they've spent on this plane, they often forget the passing of time. (Family Friend is either Revenant/Vampire/Lich...etc.) They came to call upon your deceased relative because they require aid. Perhaps the PC will be willing to answer the call?</td>

<td>Lost Heir(s) to the Throne</td>
<td> Old King Zac has no trueborn children. So when he dies, agents of the kind arrive in your far-flung village, and reveals that you are in fact the long-lost bastard son of the king! However, the old king got around. There are dozens of other bastards, of all ages and races, half-orc, half-elf, tiefling, aasimar, oread, undine, plain old human, dhampir, on and on. The king's ministers declare that all of his heirs shall vote to choose the heir to the kingdom from amongst themselves. A vote shall be held at the end of each day, until one heir holds a plurality of votes. Murder of your half-children disqualifies you on the spot. Go! Compete with your half-siblings for the ultimate power in the kingdom! The king's will demands it!</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Noble Bullies</td>
<td> Every peasant parts way as this group of three nobleman's sons walk through with their personal guards. A young street kid does not see them in time and falls to the ground when he runs into the middle one. This nobleman's son immediately challenges him to a duel and one of the others throws him a rapier, when he picks it up it is clear that he never used one. The guards turn away and form a haphazard circle.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mushroom harvesters</td>
<td> Early in the morning in this small hamlet the party wakes up from hush voices and the sound of rolling barrels. When looking out from the barn where they stay they see a small squad of goblins rolling in barrels into the towns center. When given time people from the houses come outside and walk up to them like it is no big deal and trade freshly found forest mushrooms for jugs of milk and pieces of woven cloth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The drunken troll</td>
<td> When walking upon an off-road stone bridge between villages sits and old troll, he is singing and is drinking from a barrel. When the party comes close he demands wine and ale for the crossing. He seems very sensitive about the state of his bridge, he thinks it is beautiful.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The best salesman</td>
<td> A street merchant stumbles up to strangers and asks if they want to buy special medicines, potions and charms. When you even listen for a moment he will lock onto you and start to sell you random stuff, he is very charming but a bit to up-close for comfort. It is like he is using magic to compel you to buy buy buy....</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A small mistake</td>
<td> When walking through a crowded city street two large men left up the smallest party member under the armpits a few inches of the ground and without hesitation move through the crowd towards an alley. A shady figure is waiting there, is there some kind of mistake or is this a blast from the past?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lives at Stake</td>
<td> In a small hamlet they players encounter a very helpful man, they are allowed to sleep in his barn for the night. But have to promise that whatever they do they do not come in his house. When (yes, I said when and not if) they do they notice a woman, clearly his wife. Thing is, she has a wooden stake through the lower part of her neck, it looks painful and she can not fully turn her neck. Anyone ever heard of a Pointanak?</td>

<td>A Sword's Mind</td>
<td> It is your normal Ogre hunt job, you get told where and when it will be anywhere and your job is to poke enough holes in it to make it stop moving. You never expected these enormous pit traps and the ambush when he jumps forward with to much grace, swimming with a large part of a tree trunk. But what is that, glistening inside this enormous wooden beam, a sword deeply embedded shining like the day it was made.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Beauty hides Betrayal</td>
<td> Travelling through a thick forest, it starts to get dark but open spaces are rare. But the party stumbles upon one, a large rotten tree flattened against the forest floor, overgrown with purple flowers and surrounded by a few meters of open space. The smell of the flowers is insane, insanely hallucinative. When paying attention old remains of animals litter the underground, turned to fertilizer....</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Beggar</td>
<td> An old homeless man approaches the party looking for some spare food/change. If the party takes pity on him, he reveals himself to be a wizard that has fallen on hard times and grants them some kind of magical benefit for a short period. If they dismiss him, or act harshly toward them, he curses them, turning their (entire party or just particularly cruel characters) tongues to stone before vanishing, making it so those players can no longer communicate with words. The party must then find him to remove the curse.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Really Low Level</td>
<td> The PCs are hired to clean a local magical fixture. Normally this job would be beneath an adventurer's guild, but there are just so many adventurers these days.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Evil Has A Place</td>
<td> Representatives of several evil cults, religions, and social groups are protesting and campaigning for the king to grant them equal status to all the good and neutral gods, religions, and social groups, claiming that Alignment is Not A Choice and since their gods are just as real as Good Gods, they deserve equal representation. The PCs are hired to guard one of their rallies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Almost Magical Goods</td>
<td> A local merchant approaches the PCs to help him out. He swears that someone has replaced his magical goods with "almost equivalent" versions - a bag of "sort-of" holding, a belt of somewhat useful items, potions of temporary healing, etc. The city merchant's guild is threatening to put him out of business for swindling customers, but he swears he's being set up.</td>

<td>Death and Hexes</td>
<td> An eccentric wizard dies and leaves behind his tower. He has no heirs and no will, and the city wants to claim the property and auction the contents of his tower.

<td>Old Traditions</td>
<td> A small town has a tradition of cutting a young maiden open, staking her intestine to a tree, and having her walk all the way around it. Supposedly this tradition placates some ancient beast who used to terrorize the town centuries ago. This year, it's the bar maid at a tavern the PCs frequent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>One for One</td>
<td> People are dying under mysterious circumstances in the capital city, and the healers & clerics can seem to find no cause for their deaths, as the victims just drop over dead for no apparent reason. Of course, what the town doesn't know, and the PCs are going to have to find out, is that an evil Lord has found a way using dark magic to resurrect the dead, but the cost is the life of another in the area. This Lord is currently busy in the catacombs underneath the city, using the dark magics to raise an army of the evilest, vilest, most loathsome individuals interred there, to help him take the capital, and the kingdom, and in the process he's killing the victims in the city above as collateral damage.</td>

<td>The life tree</td>

He thrusts a small, frail looking, potted plant into your hands and says "You must be the one I was supposed to meet, here take it! Remember to only plant it at the right place under the right conditions, and hurry or the world won't live to see another summer!" He then turns into an eagle and soars away, leaving you with the little potted tree.</td>

<td>An attempt on the King</td>
<td> The king was attacked from afar with an arrow. Thankfully one of his men jumped in front of the arrow and saved the king. Upon inspecting the arrow the kings men tell you that the arrow is dwarf made, but the feathers come from a rooster. You heard earlier that a shipment of arrow shafts and heads got stolen from the Dwarfs and there is a town nearby called Roost where everyone is a chicken farmer. There they can find a man called the cockslayer who slaughters old roosters. He must have supplied the attacker or attackers with the feathers for their arrows.</td>

<td>The drug crazed dragon</td>
<td> Two dragons have been known to slumber in the ruins of an ancient city for a long time. Aztorkin or Venom, the Green Dragon has been breathing his toxic fumes into the old sewers of the city for many years, to make sure no one can attack him from below. Kartharnix or Acid, the Black Dragon has slumbered for long on the other side of the ruined city. He has many slaves under his command which he sends into the sewers to mine the green hardened resin of Venoms toxic breath. Acid has figured out that when he slowly melts the resin with his acid it creates a vapor that fills him with ecstasy. However recently Acid learned that his neighbour Venom had been slain some years ago, and when his slaves informed him there was no more resin to mine, the dragon went insane. Supposedly he now tears the city apart frothing at the mouth, melting stone and steel in search of his fix. Soon he will direct his anger elsewhere, if he is not stopped.</td>

It's dated more than 600 years ago, and instead of bearing only the crest of the royal family on the back, it has an emblem with the royal families crest and 3 other crests from families you do not know. A lot of things have gone missing near the old Gnome wizards house. Not a lot of people go near it since the old gnome was found mauled to death in his laboratory. Not that people went near it when he was alive either. However a woman nearby has had all her threads and needles stolen repeatedly. Another woman reported her wedding dress missing. A few people have gone missing too and there have been reports of weird noises around the old house.</td>

<td>The Spectral Inn</td>
<td> You are starving and parched from long travel without nourishment. Walking into the first tavern building you see, you notice immediately how empty it is, and the innkeeper greets you enthusiastically, talking your ear off about a story you never asked for. As he gives you food and some time passes, you notice the wood slowly warps, cobwebs appear in the corners, and light dust has made its way onto the surfaces. As you finish your meal and make your way out, you find that the innkeeper is nowhere to be found, the doorway is boarded up, and the inn appears older than your grandfather's grandfather.</td>

A good-hearted necromancer has ressurected her brother, turning him into an intelligent undead creature not unlike a death knight, who desires to retake his rightful kingdom and end the rule of the tyrant Queen. Despite his zombie-like appearance, his benevolent attitude has earned him the favor of the (less conservative) peasantry.</td>

At first glance he seems dead, but once any one of the adventurer's touches the gold coin, he rises into the air with glowing green eyes, as the coin fuses with the palm of their hand. A booming voice emanates from the old man and informs them that they are now cursed to carry the Coin of Mammon (Demon of Greed) until they too die. With this the old man crumples to the ground in a heap. On further inspection of the old man, a map is found, the destination of which merely says "Mammon"....</td>
