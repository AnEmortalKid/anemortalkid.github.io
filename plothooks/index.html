<td>The Uninvited Guests</td>
<td> While in a city, the party is confronted by an old nobleman, whose research indicates that fey conciousnesses are about to invade an upcoming party for nobles. The man himself is not invited due to being a little... eccentric, but he can get the party invited, armed with a magical amulet to prevent the wearers conciousness from being invaded. But there's only one amulet to go around.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Missing Mistress</td>
<td> Jaelom Harns, promiscuous daughter of a local wealthy merchant, is missing. All twelve of her public suitors have fled town at the same time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dead Carnies</td>
<td> A travelling circus recently left town yesterday after spending two weeks entertaining the townsfolk. This morning, it was discovered in a smoldering ruin barely ten miles outside of town, all the entertainers dead and seemingly burned alive.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>By Gragnar's Hammer</td>
<td> Famous Dwarven smith, Gragnar Battlestein, recently did a show-and-tell at his smithy of some of techniques. Mysteriously, only two days later, his hammer went missing. It was probably one of the two hundred attendees, so at least there's a starting point for the investigation!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Green Dragon Request</td>
<td> A green dragon slowly rising to power hopes to recruit its own adventuring party. The dragon offers a sizable amount of treasure for an oh so small favor. The dragon always has more things that need doing and the rewards begin piling up, but some of the requests start putting the party into moral quandaries. (Note: this would probably work best for trying to mess with a "good" party)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hand of [Enter PC Name Here]</td>
<td> The players learn that undead have been terrorizing a nearby town lately and the culprit is likely residing in the abandoned tomb close by. The players encounter some undead (zombie dogs, mummies, etc.) while traversing the tomb but all they find out is that a lich likely resided there long ago. During the trek, however, one of the players gets bit by a wight and becomes plagued with an affliction. Have a local cleric stop the affliction from spreading, but now the PC's hand is changed forever. Give it some utility features (a minor and major advantage/disadvantage), and continue the story. Unbeknownst to the PCs, the cleric is the culprit and has been secretly researching and practicing necromancy in the tomb. At some point later in the story, have the cleric be revealed as a minor/major BBEG who became obsessed with his research and is after the PCs hand. If you want to increase the stakes, have the removal of the hand cause instant death/drop to zero HP and roll death save, and/or have the cleric confront the PCs because he can take control of the PC.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Happy Death-day</td>
<td> The party falls through a sinkhole into an underground cavern. There they find a gnome golem crafter and his golem have been declared as high priest and god, respectively, by a small tribe of Kuo-toa. The golem crafter has been trying to keep up the illusion while looking for a way out of the cavern system, but he needs help... A retired vampire-slayer and nobleman is holding a birthday party for his 10 year old son. Along with the bevy of guests, a small contingent of vampires have slipped into the party get revenge on the elderly paladin. Optional Twist: The paladin is able to lock himself inside a safe room with a couple of guests, but is separated from his son in the commotion. One of the vampires uses Magic Jar to inhabit the body of the son and tags along with the party until they can open the safe room.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Stolen Statue</td>
<td> In the street of a crossroads trading post, a wealthy merchant is heatedly accusing the blacksmith of stealing his silver dragon statue, a priceless family heirloom. The blacksmith protests his innocence, but the statue is definitely gone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Coup or Two</td>
<td> A warlord has been succeeded, not by his son, but by the captain of his guard -- a foreigner who rose to fame as a brilliant tactician and commander, the warlord's right-hand-man and the source of much of his success. Now the warlord's son is fleeing into the hills, and beseeches mercenaries for aid in reclaiming his rightful place. But not all people think the new lord is so bad, and not all people see the prince as favourably as he would like to think...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ward</td>
<td> The fortress town of Ward sits on a rocky hill on a wet, windswept coast. There is not much to do in Ward, and most of the populace is in fact in the military, dedicated to protecting the city from the frequent orc raids that come down from the mountains. Recently, contact has been lost with one of the watch posts in the hills meant to warn the city of impending attacks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Wedding of Starky McFrey</td>
<td> The NPC's are invited to the wedding of Starky McFrey. Out of nowhere the wedding guests are attacked and Starky and his wive are the first of the casualty's</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The wedding of Theon Bara</td>
<td> The NPC's are invited to the wedding of Theon Bara. Out of nowhere Theon Bara drops dead from poisoning.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>You Don't Have to Go Home, But You Can't Stay Here</td>
<td> There has been a mass exodus from the city, but it's unclear why. Everyone leaving seems to have perfectly legitimate and unrelated reasons, but everyone is going at once.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Harbinger Trump</td>
<td> Word has gotten around that the Harbinger Trump has sounded and forces are gathering in the east to fight for glory!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The New Library</td>
<td> Crowds are gathered around the gleaming new library. But there's something odd and animated about the new books and it'd better be under control before the ribbon cutting ceremony.</td>
