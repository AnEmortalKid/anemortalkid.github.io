<td>Cultist Kidnappers</td>
<td> A local jeweler and a local blacksmith have been kidnapped (From their homes, whilst on the road to a trade center etc.) and someone wants the PCs to find them. The sinister story behind it all is that a cult of some form needs their expertise to create some form of magic item/summoning circle/planar gate/mystical_evil_object of some description. The PCs should stop them. This would make a great introduction to a large story arc for low level PCs.</td>

The players encounter some undead (zombie dogs, mummies, etc.) while traversing the tomb but all they find out is that a lich likely resided there long ago. During the trek, however, one of the players gets bit by a wight and becomes plagued with an affliction. Have a local cleric stop the affliction from spreading, but now the PC's hand is changed forever. Give it some utility features (a minor and major advantage/disadvantage), and continue the story. Unbeknownst to the PCs, the cleric is the culprit and has been secretly researching and practicing necromancy in the tomb. At some point later in the story, have the cleric be revealed as a minor/major BBEG who became obsessed with his research and is after the PCs hand. If you want to increase the stakes, have the removal of the hand cause instant death/drop to zero HP and roll death save, and/or have the cleric confront the PCs because he can take control of the PC.</td>

Once the players prove their value and her trust she asks them to help the fire kingdom in the elemental plane. The elemental convergence, an event that decides which element will prevail over the others in the material plane for the next 10 thousand years, is near and war is imminent. Plot twist: even though she keeps saying that an era of fire would bring life, light and warmth to the material plane the truth is that no element ever wins the convergence and this is what keeps the material plane balanced. If an element gets an edge over the others terrible things happens on the material plane (a fire era would more likely bring firestorms, heat the planet and start a vulcanic apocalypse).</td>

While investigating, the party finds a fancy hat that looks like the hat a lord or lady might wear. How it got outside of this poor farming town is a mystery. There are no signs of magic on it, and it looks and feels just like an ordinary hat. Unbeknownst to the party though, a clutch of young mimics live in the area, and have learned the neat trick of looking like a hat causes people to pick you up and put you on their heads so you can then proceed to bite their heads off. Is one of the party members HEADed for disaster and decides to put the hat on? Will they discard it and then wonder why townfolk's heads keep disappearing? What will they do when the clutch becomes brazen enough that a half dozen or so "hats" line the road?</td>

<td>What Is Dead May Never Die</td>
<td> There is a massive shift in the spiritual world. Clerics of a specific god - including one of the PCs - find their spells have changed overnight - almost as if their god's domain had suddenly shifted. There are other strange signs. Statues or images of their god start to corrode, rot or crumble away. The signs and portents of their spells change. Instead of ravens as messenger spirits, bats. Instead of green flames, blue. Eventually, the PCs learn that somehow this god has been killed and replaced. An epic-level adventurer climbed the difficult path to the heavens and usurped this deity. Can the PCs journey to the Underworld and retrieve the slain god? Or will they throw their lot in with the newcomer? Even if they do manage to resurrect their god, will they be changed by their time with Death?</td>

<td>The Rat Pack</td>
<td> The party is wandering the roads, when they encounter a minstrel troupe, who ask where the party is headed. No matter which way they say they're going, the troupe says they're headed in that direction as well, and could they travel with the party as they're feeling a little nervous since the mercs they were paying to guard them, betrayed them instead and ran off with the troupe's money. Even if the party refuses them, the troupe will follow them closely, when confronted, they will admit that they're scared the mercs might come back and finish them off, or some other menace might get them. So, by staying close to the party, they hope things will be scared off. That night, while the party sleeps, the party member(s) on guard will find themselves suddenly attacked with a concerted barrage of mesmerize, charm, sleep, or other mind affecting spells. It turns out that the wandering troupe is actually a traveling group of Were-rats, who do this regularly to adventuring parties, caravans, merc companies, etc. Can the party survive the were-rats treachery? Alternatively, if your players are too suspicious of the troupe, you could change it so they really are a minstrel troupe that has been treated badly by a merc company, and that merc company is coming back that night while the groups are camped to finish the job. Let them get all fearful of the troupe, and then surprise them with the mercs instead.</td>

<td>Not Quite Special Someone</td>
<td> You've just finished looting adventuring in that old crypt when you are approached with a reward you were most definitely not expecting; an arranged marriage. Turns out that old king had a habit of speaking in metaphor and a court wizard who took things literally. "A commoner will marry into this family when he pries the rings from my cold dead hands!"</td>

<td>Balance</td>
<td> Rumors abound, whispering of one rising in infamy just as quickly as your own glory grows. They appear to be your opposite in nearly every way; tactically, morally, physically, only the same in power. Is it coincidence, or prophecy? Whatever it is, this antithesis of yours seems to be drawing closer.</td>

<td>Resurrection gone bad</td>
<td> First post wasn't on topic, so I'm back for more: Of course, not all resurrections are made equal. Sometimes the plant reagents have gone bad, or the wrong ones were picked. Sometimes the person had been dead for too long. And sometimes, like this time for instance, part of the characters soul was invaded by a parasite upon reentry into the physical world. Slowly, she loses the spark of life. She can still move, still talk, and is as strong as ever, but her voice has gone flat and her appetite has disappeared. At first you thought it was some sort of depression, but then last night happened. Out of the blue, her magic stopped working. The high counsel of wizards suggest you kill her again, and capture the soul as it leaves her body. This way, you can separate host from parasite, but of course, this is a dangerous, and risky process. And hasn't been tried for many centuries. Books will need to be dug up from ancient tombs, and long lost reagents found. This'll be a long one, but your characters very soul is at stake. Better act fast before there's nothing left!</td>

<td>What happens when you revive a human sacrifice?</td>
<td> Well, it turns out it depends on the diety. Some are more than happy to oblige, but others, the darker gods, want to keep what's theirs. And they punish those who would try to steal from them. And this one happens to do so by raising the dead. If you can take what's his, he can take what's yours.</td>

<td>The Chosen One?</td>
<td> Since birth, you were told you were the chosen one. The ultimate mover and shaker of the centuries. Only - now you've lost your one-ness. It seems that you've been possessed, and this creature, this seed, this thing inside of your mind, digging and burying itself further inside of your consciousness, thinks that you're not the chosen one. It is. You find yourself acting in your sleep, unable to remember what you've done. Sometimes it takes over during the day, and you can't come close to fighting its power. It acts in ways you would never imagine, and seems to be planning something against your will. It pushes you to accept quests, and reject others. All with one thing in common: blood magic.</td>

<td>To bring him back? Or just make another?</td>
<td> Resurrections aren't easy you know. They're expensive, and a time consuming process. And it doesn't always work. But you've heard tell of a cheaper way, Cloning. A wild outcast of a tinkering gnome thinks he's found a way to clone living tissue. All he needs is a spell which will extract the memories from a living being. Such a shame that the only wizard who knows of such things is evil, and living at the top of a tower a long, long way south.</td>

<td>But really, what's the difference between necromancy and resurrection?</td>
<td> That's what Elbert asked himself while studying his ancient tombs over 40 years ago. "Isn't necromancy giving life to what is already dead? And shouldn't they do what I bid? I was the one giving them life. I was the one who put purpose back into their cold and rotting corpses. It's a small cost to pay, and I'll free them eventually! All I have to do is find a way..." Or so he told himself. 40 years later, and he's hidden himself away in the catacombs, surrounded by the dead, and all alone. He believes that he can fracture the soul of a living person, and give it to the undead. Little does he know, he's making a lich that MUST be stopped.</td>

<td>Robbed, then Framed</td>
<td> Inside a busy town, the party is robbed by a passing vandal. Following a small chase scene, detailed with the typical cart dodging and stall vaulting, the party will catch the thief in some dead end alleyway. Palms up, swearing no trickery, the thief will return the party's stolen belongings. The thief will also helpfully forfeit some of his other stolen wares as well. Returning to the market place, a well armed group of guards will stop our merry band of adventurers. "In the King's name, your are charged with breaking into the high vault of the Royal Treasury. Stand down, criminal scum, and accept your punishment - death!"</td>

Be warned, however, should the Child encounter any danger and not return unharmed, the wrath of the Kingdom will fall against our fair adventurers.</td>

<td>A Funny Thing Happened on the Quay by the Forum</td>
<td> A merchant from a distant city has arrived, swathed in acres of silk, and has managed to simultaneously undercut and outprofit nearly every fishmonger on the quay, seemingly overnight. No self-respecting angler will admit to selling fish to the foreigner, and the local guild is considering artificially inflating the price of seafood so that other merchants can compete. More troubling, several of the waterfront's resident urchins/couriers/pickpockets have gone missing, and reports of dark shapes in the water have caused the watch to establish ban on swimming.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>A song to follow</td>
<td> After a long day on the road, the party settles in a small, lively inn. As soon as the party's bard starts playing (or, if the party lacks one, the local fiddler), a beautiful, yet eerie woman starts singing strange lyrics to the melody that describe a way through the local country side to an abandoned house and end with the words: "Party Face's Name found the lone hound's hall / and recognized it well / and by the very last breath's call / they ended the demon's spell". The mysterious singer cannot remember anything, but will repeat the words when the tune is played again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Cursed Coin</td>
<td> In the middle of the path ahead of the party lays the body of an old man, with a large gold coin clutched in his cold hand. At first glance he seems dead, but once any one of the adventurer's touches the gold coin, he rises into the air with glowing green eyes, as the coin fuses with the palm of their hand. A booming voice emanates from the old man and informs them that they are now cursed to carry the Coin of Mammon (Demon of Greed) until they too die. With this the old man crumples to the ground in a heap. On further inspection of the old man, a map is found, the destination of which merely says "Mammon"....</td>

<td>The Thirsty River</td>
<td> A mother and child rest at the side of the road suckling on sweat soaked bandanas. When they see the adventurer's they ask for water and tell them about a curse that's been laid on the town just up the road. The river flows with fresh water but when the water enters a person's mouth it turns to sand. A local coven has cursed the town for breaking a deal with them.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mirror Image</td>
<td> A covered mirror, found the by the party, turns out to be magic. It shows a glimpse of the future (based on the character's background) by altering the appearance of whatever is reflected in the mirror (this can be the appearance of the character including physical features or clothing/equipment, or the surrounding location). Characters roll a d20 to determine how good or bad what they see is (the lower the roll, the worse, and the higher, the better). At the end of their vision, a second d20 is rolled to determine if something they saw (such as a scar, wound, armor, or location effect like a building behind them being on fire) is permanent in the real world (10 or lower, something is permanent, 5 or lower ensures it is something bad, a critical 1 requires it to be a serious injury, and a critical 20 provides a powerful boon). One character sees a vision of himself shattering the mirror. Any attempt to shatter the mirror fails - it cannot be broken by any standard means.</td>

<td>A Kitchen Nightmare</td>
<td> The city is abuzz, as word has spread that a great and world famous chef, Riordan Gamsy, has come to the city and will be cooking a meal for the king. But, in order to cook this exquisite meal, he will need exclusive and rare ingredients procured for him, and sure enough the kingdom hires the PCs to acquire said ingredients. The list is full of hard to obtain ingredients, such as a moss that only grows on the bodies of zombies, and the meat of a Bullette, etc., you get the point. But, after gathering all these ingredients, and bring them to Chef Gamsy, he has to admit to the PCs that he doesn't actually know how to cook very well. He's a con man who just kind of stumbled into this gig of being a world famous chef. He makes lists of ingredients that he knows no one in their right mind would ever gather, and lives off the generosity of the king/queen/etc. while waiting for the ingredients to be procured, and then when they fail to procure the ingredients, he gets huffy, says he will not compromise his art, and then moves off to the next kingdom. No one has ever been able to get all the ingredients before, and he doesn't know what to do now, as this lord will actually be expecting him to create a mind-blowing meal with the ingredients the party has gotten. First he'll beg the party for help, but if they refuse he'll threaten the party, saying that if they don't help them with his situation he'll tell the lord that they were in on the scam as well, and they'll all go to the chopping block together. What does the party do?</td>

This Lord is currently busy in the catacombs underneath the city, using the dark magics to raise an army of the evilest, vilest, most loathsome individuals interred there, to help him take the capital, and the kingdom, and in the process he's killing the victims in the city above as collateral damage.</td>

Kartharnix or Acid, the Black Dragon has slumbered for long on the other side of the ruined city. He has many slaves under his command which he sends into the sewers to mine the green hardened resin of Venoms toxic breath. Acid has figured out that when he slowly melts the resin with his acid it creates a vapor that fills him with ecstasy. However recently Acid learned that his neighbour Venom had been slain some years ago, and when his slaves informed him there was no more resin to mine, the dragon went insane. Supposedly he now tears the city apart frothing at the mouth, melting stone and steel in search of his fix. Soon he will direct his anger elsewhere, if he is not stopped.</td>

The length of his new 'life' has given him strength and cunning, as well as a place beside the Necromancer's throne of skulls, but he hungers for something more. Perhaps with his master's death he may find an end - one way or another.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turncloak</td>
<td> The youngest son of a noble house at whose castle the party is currently laying siege, slips out of the castle and into besiegers' encampment. He offers to open the postern gate to allow the party's forces inside to slaughter his father, his brothers, and their loyal men to end the siege quickly. He asks only that at the end the siege they turn the castle over to him.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turnsail</td>
<td> On a moonless night, after "acquiring" an ancient elvish artifact from the manse of one of the city's most powerful merchants, the party races to the harbor to make their escape. While rowing out into the bay to meet the ship on which they had planned to sail, they see the ship raise sail and head out to the open sea, leaving them behind.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turnsword</td>
<td> Over breakfast, the party receives a note from the captain of a mercenary company whom they have employed: "They are willing to pay me more. The price is double, or I walk. This is business, not personal."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Prickly Princess</td>
<td> One morning after a night of carousing in the city, the party is met by the Watch in the street, clasped in irons, and marched off to a jail cell. The following day, the princess who had formerly been very friendly visits them. She heard about some forays into a certain brothel whose madame has been most slanderous about the royal family.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turnkey</td>
<td> A notorious outlaw Beardo the Black has been captured and is now rotting in a cell in the city's prison thanks to the heroic efforts of the party. Early the following morning after a night of celebrating, the party is summoned to the prison at the behest of the captain of the City Watch. When they get there, the captain and the chief gaoler tell them that the outlaw has escaped and the turnkey on-duty has been killed, his head smashed repeatedly against the stone floor. The guards on-duty say that no one has entered or left the prison save the warden, the captain, a few guards changing shifts, and the afternoon turnkey leaving after the now-dead turnkey arrived.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turncloth</td>
<td> A priest approaches the party in a tavern one evening. He says he has had it with the hypocrisy of the temple brass, and he's looking for some help to loot the temple treasury. He can get you in, but he'll need help getting back out.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Dive</td>
<td> After recovering a hard-fought haul in a tomb or ancient ruin, the party arrives back in town to tuck into some ales at their favorite dive bar. Tedd the barkeep greets them warmly. Nilla the barmaid smiles knowingly as she sways around the bar to bring her favorite heroes their usual libations. Halfway through the first round of drinks, the party members start to feel a bit dizzy. Tedd trudges across the barroom and says, "I had no choice. They arrive right before you did. I'm sorry." The bar is now crowded with crossbowmen in mail, wearing purple and black cloaks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Mole</td>
<td> Gethers the one-eyed, grotesquely fat boss of the Dead Mouse Gang with whom you've worked before dismisses the pair of lackeys that accompanied him to meet you here at this pub. "Someone is informing on me. Someone on the inside. Lord Commander Hodge has been waiting for us at the site of three of the last four drops from some of our smuggling contractors. We've stayed out of it, but I'm running out of smugglers. I need you to find the mole."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Turnabout is Foul Play</td>
<td> After enrolling in a tournament of skill, agility, and strength at the behest of their mysterious sponsor, the party discovers that nearly every challenge has been rigged against them. At first, it's simple, petty things; an arrow without fletching, a set of weighted die. But when a steeplechase across town ends in the tragic deaths of a beloved noblewoman and her lover, all signs point to something more sinister.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Turn of the Shrew</td>
<td> Old Heddy has for years been the go-to gossip for up to date news on the goings on of all aspects of life in the city. For the price of a drink and a little ribald conversation, she could be relied on to dispense a juicy tidbit or two on who may have been seen stepping out with whom, and what dock may have received a secret shipment of godshit. But when the party attempts to pay her a visit in her customary corner of the Heron's Bill, she hisses, spits, and gives them the evil eye; the bartender - a wise man - advises they run.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Turn After Reading</td>
<td> A struggling restaurateur has hired the party to do the unthinkable - sabotage his competitors. A renowned critic of all things gastronomic is in town, and the poor chef's only chance of receiving a favorable review is to shine in comparison to his peers. The adventurers are provided a simple map, a vial of something noisome, and a hefty sum of unmarked coins, and are sent out into the streets to wreak some culinary espionage. When they arrive at their first destination however, they find that the poison isn't just putrid - it's deadly.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>You Live, You Turn</td>
<td> When a notorious Viscount betrays the party, it comes as no surprise - already wary of traps and duplicitousness, they make their escape from his mountain manor with ease. But many months later, while traveling through a port city, they're alarmed to find a wanted poster hanging from the door of the inn, the windows of the shops, and in the hands of the sheriff's deputies. To add insult to injury, the list of supposed crimes verges on the ridiculous, including things like 'Theft of the Crown Prince's Dreams' and 'High Treason Against the Unified Tonalities of A Flat Minor'. Nevertheless, the local law seems intent on prosecution, and the only alibi they have rests on the word of a man who has already betrayed them once, and seems likely to do so again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Poacher</td>
<td> A small group have been hunting a certain animal/magical beast to extinction, and willing to threaten or kill the druids trying to protect their land. One of the poachers is willing to help kill his fellow poachers for the right price/favor.</td>

<td>Under New Management</td>
<td> You return to your favorite inn and/or brothel to find that the original owner of the establishment has met an unfortunate and bloody end. Luckily, their second-in-command and/or assistant has been only too happy to pick up the slack, and they assure you that it will not affect your relationship. Everything seems just a little too neat and tidy...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>No Loose Ends</td>
<td> The party has just killed the Big Bad, and they're returning to Castle Goodguy for their just reward. They're battered, they're bloody, but they're victorious. When they reach the palace, however, someone starts sniping at them from a guard tower. Then two someones. Then the entire city guard. The party has been ordered executed, and the order comes straight from the Crown.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Change of Heart</td>
<td> A fearsome knight in black armor approaches the camp at night, unarmed and asking for parley. Upon interrogation, he reveals that his master, the cruel king of the neighboring realm, is planning on slaughtering the firstborn of every household. While he would much prefer to kill the adventurers and be rid of their meddling, his honor demands that he seek the help of the most able to avert this atrocity.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Make Her Pay</td>
<td> The youngest son of a noble family hires the party to find and kill a witch who has been warping the minds of the populace. Upon further investigation, the girl is not a witch, but in fact an ex-fiancee who spurned his advances when she learned of his own delvings into the black arts.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shanghaied</td>
<td> The Horses Replacement is one of the rowdiest dockside inns in Brightbluff, so it's par for the course when a group of rough looking half-orcs invite the party to a drinking contest. The drinks go down easy but win or lose, they'll be drunk and tired by the end of it. Unfortunately for them, the bitter old ex-cavalier who runs this establishment has a deal worked out with the half-orcs and their accomplices, and a discreet set of tunnels under each room wind their way right to the water and their boats. Passing out at the inn, they'll find themselves miles out to sea and suddenly the newest unwilling crewmembers (or slaves) aboard ship.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Ranger Who Couldn't Catch a Break</td>
<td> While traveling in the forest, the floor suddenly collapses beneath a member of the party, and they narrowly avoid being speared by the ranger hiding within the pit trap. As the ranger stares at them, his eyes widen in fear and he murmurs, "Oh gods, not again..."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Slightly Unhelpful Wizard</td>
<td> As payment for their most recent job, the party is given a bag containing a set of incredibly light plate armor, an ornate stopwatch, and a dagger emanating with a seemingly heatless flame. At the bottom of the bag is a small piece of parchment with an address written on it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Onwards, noble steed!</td>
<td> One of the party's horses - the Paladin's War Steed, maybe? Suddenly turns wild and bucks off its rider, just as they are about to charge into combat. It will not allow its former rider to approach, let alone ride, although other people may be able to lead it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>My Castle Now</td>
<td> The PCs, having acquired wealth and noble standing after many adventures, come home from a hard month's dungeoning to discover that their loyal castellan is no longer so loyal, and has barred the gates against them, claiming the castle as their own. Can they besiege their own fortress?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Death rides a Pony!</td>
<td> The avatar of Death appears to the party, and tells them he will be taking them all during their next dungeon. Buuuutttt, he will give them a pass if they help him recover his steed, which has been stolen by one of the other Horsemen. The problem is that he doesn't know which of the other Horsemen has his stallion, and so Death expects them to approach each of the other Horsemen about it. Of course the other Horsemen won't just give up info about the theft, the party will have to figure out ways to make the Horsemen cooperate.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Constructing Trouble</td>
<td> A wealthy town has a detachment of Golems that are used in the town defense. A squad of mages builds and maintains these automaton guards. What these mages don't know is that one of their apprentices is in actuality a powerful mage for the opposing side who has managed to make sure during the creation of each Golem that there is a command word embedded inside them to allow him/her to take control of said Golems when the time is right. Such as when the opposing side has an army outside to take the city mayhaps?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rumors of Betrayal</td>
<td> The party arrives in a city where the King is away on a crusade, but the Queen is still around. They party goes about their business, until after a day or so, they realize that people are starting to stare at them and speaking in hushed tones behind their backs. Sooner or later the party will discover that there is a rumor floating around that the King has taken a lover while off on crusade, and has now sent that lover back to the kingdom for his/her safety. Of course, one of the party members is that rumored lover. Who's behind these rumors? Is there a secret lover trying to shift blame to someone else? Is a lord or lady trying to make some sort of power play? Is the thieves guild trying to stir up troubles to distract from their actions? Can the party stop the rumors? And what will happen when the Queen hears of these rumors?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mutiny!</td>
<td> The party are resigned to a week or so aboard The Dowager Bride, working their passage across the Mirror Sea to the Outer Isles. The Captain, Morrun Jake, was loath to take them but has agreed eventually on account of the Bard's sea shanties or the Cleric's blessing or the Wizard's knowledge of Arabay legend, or somesuch. The deal is struck in a dockside bar, after a long spell drinking with the Captain, his first mate, the Bosun, and the Purser. Every day the sun shines, the sea is calm, and the wind is good. Every evening includes a spell at the Captain's table for at least some of the party, eating, drinking, telling stories, gambling a little. The rest get to break bread with the ordinary seamen. In between some work swabbing decks, stitching sails and repairing the rigging, the party has ample time to heal up, learn spells, swap stories, and practice weapons skills on the deck with various interesting sea-dog types. Friendships are made, and maybe some friction too in places. But a quiet interval between adventures is just what the doctor ordered. Until last bell on the third Friday at sea when Black Pete the Purser and Carter the Bosun slit Jake's throat as he sleeps and claim the captaincy. The crew are split and it looks like it's going to get ugly. With the party having good relations with some on both sides, how will the they play it?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The haven</td>
<td> The party is currently fleeing danger, they conveniently come across a friendly person who offers them refuge to avoid their pursuers. Little does the party know that this person is a sadist/torturer/killer and once they get into the person's house they'll be featured in the new SAW movie.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The healer</td>
<td> Someone in the party has been afflicted by a curse, the local healer says that that person can be cured but it will cost greatly, demanding huge amounts of coin for "reagents" and other precious materials the party conveniently has. Once they have given enough the healer will ask for sacrifices, such as pints of blood and pounds of flesh.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The highwayman</td>
<td> As the party walks down a road they're approached by a single -apparently unarmed- shady looking fellow, he asks the group if they're in for a quick buck. Once they agree, the highwayman will tell them that a caravan of merchants is due to pass by that same road in a matter of minutes/hours, but he can't take them on alone. Once the PCs assault the caravan, the "merchants" reveal themselves to be bandits, partners to the shady fellow.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Judas</td>
<td> Have a minor henchman idolize someone in the party, he will mess up once in a while but that's because he's clumsy. The first moment the party starts causing mischief he will sneak out one night and offer guards info on the party in exchange for money.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Medic</td>
<td> A young person claims to be a medic and it's searching for some herbs to make a cure. He does "warn" the group about the dangers they're about to face. Each time they come back the medic needs yet another (more dangerous) reagent for his cure. The "warning" could be something like: "Be wary, the leaves of X plant might be poisonous in a large enough dose". But he conveniently omitted the massive cloud of noxious spores the plant segregates when threatened.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The protege</td>
<td> A very liked NPC (usually young) who follows the party has his/her own goals, after following them for a while that person realizes that reaching that goal won't come soon. Have a different band of "adventurers" appear as a rival match for the party, eventually making the protege</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lovers</td>
<td> The party encounter a lone young dandy, Joraldo Callico, on the losing side of a drunken fist-fight with a hulking stevedore, Henk. Joraldo, love-lorn and in his cups, had made the mistake of lustily insulting the Scheffer family scion, Konrat Schefferson, within earshot of Henk. He works for the Scheffers. Most of the stevedores do around this part of the docks. Turns out the Callicos (southern hosiery and silk scarves) and the Scheffers (furs and leather from the north) have a long-standing and bitter mercantile feud. But Joraldo, a relatively unimportant young nephew of his family's current head, cares about the feud only in-so-far as it prevents him from marrying the love of his life, Kirstel Scheffersdotor, youngest daughter of Konrat himself. He shows the party the letters she has sent him, and describes how she is practically kept prisoner since broaching the subject of marriage with her father. Her last letter implores him to free her so that they can elope together. If the party can unite the lovers at the Crocus Inn by midnight tonight, they can have a barrel of Callico gold and as many silk scarves as they can carry, plus Joraldo's undying thanks. Springing Kirstel is a big job, and fraught with danger, but, assuming that they successfully deliver the beautiful, doe-eyed, love-struck girl to Joraldo and his surprisingly large retinue in an upstairs bedroom at the designated rendezvous, he will be overjoyed, handing over the reward and thanking them profusely as he suddenly drives a serrated dagger up under Kirtsel's ribs whispering, "Callico honour! Death to Scheffer dogs!" into her shocked and pain-twisted face. Whatever way the subsequent events immediately unfold ... How long will it take before the Scheffers get their revenge? Where, when, and how will it manifest?</td>

<td>Retirement Home For Former Heroes</td>
<td> At a ribbon cutting ceremony for a newly funded home for aged out adventurers, the keynote speaker Mack the Medicocre, has been turned to stone. One of his former enemies finally got the last laugh and used a scroll to turn the semi-famous adventuer into a pigeon rest. The party has to find some of Mack's old enemies and recover the scroll so he can be turned back to normal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Will He or Won't He</td>
<td> The party receives a contract from the Thieves' Guild to recover a particularly rare jewel, on behalf of an unnamed noble who is sponsoring the contract. The next day, the party's rogue (or the least trustworthy member) is contacted privately by the guildmaster's lieutenant. If the rogue will secretly return the jewel directly to the guildmaster, with the other party members none the wiser, he can collect the entire payment for himself. Will he take the chance? What if the lieutenant offers a path to promotion within the guild? How will he pull it off?</td>

<td> In light of a recent catastrophe, a well-known public figure declares extermination of a minority (tieflings work best here). PCs need not be the minority, but works best if they have emotional connections to the marginalized</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fried Piper of Hamlin</td>
<td> A bard shows up in a town pushing an Organ (or whatever large musical instrument suits your fancy). He attempts to solve the issue of hunger in the town by playing an extremely fire beat, which somehow magically produces food within the instrument itself that can be retrieved and consumed. However, this act of generosity raises the ire of F&B business owners, especially when paying customers start flocking to said bard for free, better-tasting food.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Monster's Monster</td>
<td> Just after hearing rumors about the gruesome and unholy rituals conducted by the head of the local Merchant's Guild, none other than Higarth Braedown - the aforementioned head - barges into the tavern and hurries to your table. His paunchy frame and pallid skin clue you in that something has him deeply worried. "I know you've heard the rumors," he begins, "and I'm afraid they're all true. But worse yet, things have gotten sorely out of hand with one of my underlings. Someone needs to take care of him... Gah, I've created a monster!"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Applying Leverage</td>
<td> One cool, breezy night, an arrow finds it's way through an open window and into your bedpost. Closer inspection reveals a scroll tied around the shaft, with instructions for kidnapping the family of the magistrate and promise of a hefty sum to be payed upon completion. Suddenly your earlier conversation with the Prince about his holdings being under investigation for harboring contraband doesn't seem so innocent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Oh sweet Justice</td>
<td> A beloved NPC is to stand trial in this less than reputable piece of mud that calls itself a town, furthermore you have seen the results of their rudimentary form of justice dangling int he town square. He is accused of stealing the scepter of the high priest and this one seems determined to burn and flail everything to get it back. To bad the real thief is still at large, with this scepter, and your beloved NPC is about to be reduced a size category.</td>

<td>Against the Moon and Sea</td>
<td> You ventured deep into the cliff-side dungeon. The former fortress and now resting place of a group of pirates seem totally at ease when you first stepped in. You knew you had 6 hours before high tide would once again flush this place, however after what must have been about 4 hours everything starts to turn against you, can you make it out in time or will your bones be added to piles?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cold Hard Ground Below</td>
<td> The feeling and sound of the airship giving away beneath your feet, slowly sinking to the cold hard shores below, it one of the most frightening things you experienced. In the moment you knew what it meant, one of your assailants must have taken out the captain and their combined weight added to your cargo is to much for the ship to bear. The enormous flying reptiles he called Wyvern keep on thrashing the ship, you and your men have to make a choice, save some crew or fight your way to the back to take control over the now rapidly increasing descent of the ship.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Put This On</td>
<td> The city's best chef is making the only meal that brings the city's biggest crime boss from hiding. Your players have gathered all the evidence necessary to finally take him down. As the party gets ready to enter the restaurant, they see the entire wait and kitchen staff exit, grumbling about their former employer. The party's half-elf used to have a lemonade stand. How hard could working one night in a restaurant be, really?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Greetings... FROM THE FUTURE!</td>
<td> The party receives a warm letter from a wizard they've never met thanking them for narrowly averting a disaster, and for being such good longtime friends. Almost immediately they receive a second letter, this one written in a much shakier and blunter hand imploring the PCs to help fixing the paradox the wizard has accidentally set in motion by sending his first letter too soon and changing history. Twist: The party must at one point fight their past selves Twerst: The wizard is one of the PCs from the future</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Doctor is in(capable of saving you)</td>
<td> That last bout of adventuring has left one of you close to death, and the only thing that can save you is a potion made from strange and ethereal ingredients (blood from an enemy-turned friend? a rare and mystical herb that only grows near lies?) that you must gather before time runs out! Twist: The illness is caused by an affliction of evil spirits that you have to fight/persuade/threaten out of your friend Twerst: They're making it up to get you out of the city</td>

<td>Eternal Sunshine of the Draughtless Mind</td>
<td> A very rich widower can't stand being tortured by memories of their dead spouse, and a disreputable alchemist has developed a potion capable of transporting you into their memories. The PCs must wander through from cherished memory to cherished memory and destroy any traces of their spouse they find (kill them at their birthday, replace the spouse with a PC at their wedding) before the potion runs out! Twist: They find memories and information that could allow them to blackmail the widower Twerst: They find out the widower killed their spouse and are under investigation</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Archaeological Opportunities</td>
<td> A group of mages from the local divination school have discovered, through vigorous study of historical tomes, and/or some chance scrying spell, the location of a long-lost ruin. The ruin is very remote and difficult to reach, explaining why it was never found. Because of this though, the mages need you to lead an expedition to the location, not only to confirm its location, but also to make sure it is safe, and to clear any possible threats you come across, in order to secure the way for a proper archaeological team. Possible ruin ideas: <li>Ancient library containing unique information believed to be lost to time</li>
 <li>A brilliant historical mage/alchemist/inventor's laboratory, possibly containing incredibly rare/valuable artifacts</li>
 <li>Ruined city of a dead civilization, possibly holding clues related to their downfall</li>
 <li>A huge device (weapon?) built ages ago by an order of skilled craftsmen</li>
 <li>The hidden lair of a legendary ancient dragon, long-since-dead, likely to still contain its undiscovered hoard</li>

<td>Pirates!!</td>
<td> Over the past several weeks, several trade ships due into [city]'s port have failed to arrive. We fear the worst at this point, and something must be done to make sure it doesn't continue. Obviously pirates are almost certainly the cause, so we've prepared an armed exploratory vessel to sail to the last place these ships were spotted. We need you to find the pirates, locate their base of operations, and wipe them all out; no punishment is too severe for those murderous dogs! Potential twist: The cause of the disappearances may or may not actually be pirates.  </td>

<td>A Wizard Is Never Late</td>
<td> Things look bad, and POOF! there's that powerful ally who never seems to be around when things get thick. He's slinging fireballs and lightning bolts and mowing down enemies with his shining staff. Once the dust has settled, the wizard tells you that he made a terrible mistake, instead of going north, it is urgent that you go around to the south. The enemy has sealed off the northerly route...</td>

You're all that's left to stop the cursed one before he marries the princess on the morrow and cements his place as tyrant of the kingdom. The foul thing throws you across the stone chamber, crashing into a wooden chair. You find yourself on the ground with a splintered chair leg inches from your fingertips...</td>

<td>The Good Guys</td>
<td> The caravan is two days from reaching the city at the other side of the wasteland. It's been a harrowing journey—sandstorms, desert wolves, and mounted bandits. You've repelled wave upon wave have hit the caravan, but you must see the ancient book safely to the scholars in the Golden Temple of the Sun. You will not be able to hold off against the bandits another time. You see a score of riders approaching across the dunes. Preparing for one desperate, last stand, you find a bit of high ground and hunker down behind a row of wagons and tightly tied pack animals. That's when the banners become clear. It's a retinue of Soldiers of Light who have come searching for you. The commander tells you that he will be taking the book the rest of the way...</td>

<td>Here Come the Heroes</td>
<td> A young lad who's always hanging around your favorite watering hole runs up to you, breathless. Panting, he tells you that your favorite tavern has been taken over by a notorious gang of street toughs. They're guzzling ale and wine and making the proprietor's daughter dance lewdly atop the bar. It's only a matter of time before they ransack the rooms and the cellar and find the valuables you're keeping there—if the proprietor hasn't sold you out already. Rolling up your sleeves, you hoof it across town...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>How big can it possibly get?</td>
<td> A town and nearby forest has been almost completely drained of magic, fey seem especially weak and the more magically aligned seem to even be suffering from a sickness due to the unnatural lack of magical energy. In the forest lies a crazed wizard, driven into isolation years ago after he forgot to feed his pet ooze and it went on a feeding rampage. In the center of the forest lies that same wizard, channeling all the magic energy he can into his ooze causing it to grow to gigantic proportions with an equally gigantic appetite.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lights, Camera, Action!</td>
<td> Once every five years, the ruler of a city will grant someone a special audience and even grant them anything under his power to bestow. The catch? The person who gets the audience has to win a talent show judged by the ruler himself, full of singing, dancing, acting and anything entertaining. Bards from all over the kingdom gather for this opportunity and the competition is fierce. Twist: The king has a very unique taste in entertainment.</td>

<td>Media Rez Goblin Attack</td>
<td> Instead of hook for everyone, give each player a quick sentence or two about their current situation, a goblin ambush on their village. "Fighter, you keep pushing against the door as the goblins's makeshift batter ram batters against the aging doors planks. The villagers behind you huddle in terror at the back of the church, trapped. Please make a Strength check to keep the doors closed" "Thief, under you 4 well armed goblins prowl around your house, poking long spears into your belongings. Your muscles begin to quiver under the strain of holding yourself in place, outstreched between the rafters. You wide eyed younger sister clings to your back, watching the goblins with you. Make an Stealth check followed by Strength check" "Bard, 15 children huddle with you in the shed as a large goblin patrol moves by. Terrified, one of them begins to cry. What do you want to do?" Etc...</td>
