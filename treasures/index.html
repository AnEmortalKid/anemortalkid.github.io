<tr>
<td>7 Bolts of gold embroidered fabric</td>
<td>Trade Goods</td>
<td> The finest linens from the Far East and fancy royal robes could be made with these.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Silver Sickles</td>
<td>Coins</td>
<td> These crescent moon-shaped coins are large enough to hold a copper farthing in their inner diameter</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Manticore Nesting Materials</td>
<td>Monster Garbage</td>
<td> Amongst the sticks and rocks that make up the nest, an assortment of rusty weapons, tattered clothes, horse barding and other gear can be found. If the party spends 10 minutes going through it all, they find a scroll case with the King's messenger service emblem on the lid and a few coin purses containing 34 gold pieces.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Overly-excited Throwing Stars</td>
<td>Ranged</td>
<td> Sentient shuriken that when thrown scream "Wheeeee!", negating sneak attack damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Coatl Feather</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> This foot long, iridescent feather is supple to the touch. Though it does not retain any of the magical essence of its former owner, it could fetch a reasonable price from a collector or fashion designer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Illithidium Ingot</td>
<td>Metal</td>
<td> A 5kg gunmetal gray ingot with an oily purple sheen and spiralling engravings on its surface. Crafted by Mindflayers in the depths below through unspeakable rituals, it is psychoreactive, psionically moldable, and supernaturally durable and useful for crafting if one knows how to work it. Whatever unnatural force binds this metal together is destroyed by purifying sunlight, causing it to rapidly rust away, even when magically enchanted.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blasphemous Statuettes</td>
<td>Art</td>
<td> This set of 8cm tall figurines depict the gods engaged in lewd, lascivious, or otherwise despicable acts unbefitting their divine nature. Extensively detailed in all the wrong places. Collectors should be careful not to complete the whole set, lest they bring down the wrath of the heavens upon themselves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tome of Arousal</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magical Item</td>
<td> This five-thousand word, clinical manual is an immensely detailed description of the physiological and neurological processes of arousal and alertness. Some minor magic has infiltrated the tome and causes a heightened state of self-awareness after ten minutes of reading. Reading the tome for an hour or more produces a sensation akin to continual sexual arousal and stimulation. These effects cease the instant the reader looks away from the tome. If the reader continues to read for longer than 8 hours, they experience random, acute narcoleptic episodes for the following 24 hours.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Skin-bound Ledger</td>
<td>Information</td>
<td> A small lined notebook bound in supple, tanned leather, with a dedication in the front cover reading "Binding from Reijek, RIP." Touching the ledger produces a deep sense of revulsion strong enough to prevent the weak-willed from looking at its contents. Inside is written a detailed list of transactions, with columns for Name, Quantity (g), Surface Area(m2 ), Skin Quality, and Police Inquiry (y/n?).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Zerth Braid</td>
<td>Consumable Magic Item</td>
<td> Taken from an elderly Githzerai monk, this 10cm length of dark brown hair contains a shadow of its former owner's psionic power. As an action, it may be used to cast Mage Hand (the hand is invisible) once per short rest. It may also be used to cast Shield as a reaction, but is destroyed in the process as it expends the entirety of its energy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Orb of Vacuum Polarization</td>
<td>McGuffin</td>
<td> Filled with scintillating colors and pinpoints of light swirling in a nebula, this large glass orb randomly fills the vacuum of space with infinitesimal matter and anti-matter pairs that immediately annihilate each other. This partially counteracts electric fields in a vacuum, albeit minorly. Sounds powerful, but no one is quite sure what any of that means.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Okayberries</td>
<td>Supplies</td>
<td> Collected from large shrubberies in the deep woods where little light penetrates the canopy, these slightly unripe, purple berries are hard and mostly flavorless. A creature can use its action to eat an Okayberry. Eating a berry restores 0.5 hitpoints (rounded down), and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for 15 minutes. Up to 6d4 berries are found at a time, and spoil after 2 weeks. They never fully ripen or taste any better.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Moistanite</td>
<td>Gems</td>
<td> Glimmering, clear gems that can be magically produced during storms of wild magic. Each is as brilliant and clear as a diamond, but they are usually larger and less over-priced, though they are- paradoxically- magically inert and useless as components in spells. They are perpetually clammy and precipitate dew even in the driest desert. A large handful of Moistanite may be squeezed to produce a trickle of clean water.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tin of Inspiration</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magic Item</td>
<td> A pocket-sized, metal box with inspirational quotes painted on the side in various languages ("You can do it!", "Follow your dreams!", and, inexplicably, "Losing isn't so bad!"). Opening the hinged lid of the box reveals a small illusory locker room containing a coach in the middle of a high-pitched, half-time pep-talk to a group of underdogs. Closer inspection reveals every entity in the box has the exact physical features of the person who opened the box. The speech will continue as long as the box is open, though the coach becomes increasingly desperate, sweaty, and incoherent after 2 hours. When the box is closed, there is a barely audible cheer of "Team spirit!" from the entities.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blade Tattoo</td>
<td>Consumable Magic Item</td>
<td> Tattoo and ink set allowing up to 12 tattoos to be made. Can be used to tattoo any non-magical weapon onto a live body. As a bonus action can be removed, tearing the tattoo from the skin, which forms into a bony, fleshy form of that weapon. DC 12 Con when removed, on failure take 1d6 damage and nauseated for one round. On success, take half damage. Weapon dissolves after five minutes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mezzard's Pipe</td>
<td>Smoking Pipe</td>
<td> Mezzard Youngstrike’s pipe. Stories tell that Mezzard used wizard’s weed religiously and was always seen with a pipe in hand or mouth. This pipe’s magic constantly refills its bowl with whatever wizard’s weed is contained in the enchanted pouch connected to it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mezzard's Enchanted Pouch</td>
<td>Drug Pouch</td>
<td> Mezzard Youngstrike’s pouch that is linked to Mezzard’s Pipe. The interior of the pouch is a 20ft square space used to keep Wizard’s Weed and other drugs. The interior of the pouch keeps all plants and drugs fresh for use forever, untainted by outside sources. If you put this pouch in another extradimensional space, ie bag of holding, both extradimensional spaces collapse and a portal to the Astral Plane opens, sucking in anything within 10 feet and teleporting them to a random location on the Astral Plane. The portal is one way.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Porcelain Plate of Anger</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magical Items</td>
<td> This white dinner plate is simply adorned with a blue stripe that goes around the brim. When someone picks up the plate, they must immediately make a will save (or game equivalent) or be irrationally angry for 1d4+1 rounds. In addition, the plate is then immediately thrown against the nearest wall or ground (This effect takes up the first round of anger). The plate shatters upon impact, but magically fixes itself after 1d6 minutes. The rage effect can happen three of times per day per person. If the person picking up the plate is a barbarian that has rage rounds, these rounds can be used as free rage rounds. The number of rounds caused by the plate does not count against the number of rounds they can rage in a day.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Folding Bridge</td>
<td>Better than nothing magic items</td>
<td> This item looks like an unassuming 8 ft. plank of lumber, but close examination of the ends reveals seams in the wood. The seams can be pulled apart to unfold the plank to form a solid bridge of any of the following sizes: It takes a full round to unfold the bridge from one size to the next. It can be folded back up to its portable size at the same rate. Once unfolded, the bridge can be placed across any gap and holds in place without apparent support. It can withstand up to 40,000 pounds in weight; any excess weight causes the bridge to break, permanently destroying it. The bridge can be easily be lifted at either end. Regardless of size the bridge itself always weighs the same as it does in its plank form (15 lb.) plus the weight of whatever is currently atop it. The collapsible bridge can be attuned to a particular person. Once attuned, only that person may unfold or fold the bridge, until it is attuned to someone else. Furthermore, only the person so attuned can lift the bridge once placed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Inflatable Skeletons Box</td>
<td>Better than nothing magic items</td>
<td> A palm-sized heaxagonal box carved from ebony, with a removal lid on both sides. Both lids are etched in the design of a skull, one smaller than the other. When opened, the off-white contents within begin inflating rapidly like a balloon filling with gas. If the larger skull lid is removed, after thirty seconds of inflation a human skeleton appears in a free space adjacent to the box. The skeleton is genuine and not in itself magical. If the smaller skull lid is removed, inflation takes twenty seconds and a halfling skeleton appears instead. The box can create one inflatable skeleton per day. If a skeleton is created while another exists, the first crumbles to dust. Perfect for causing distractions, framing enemies, and entertaining at children's parties.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Laughing Idol</td>
<td>Better than nothing magic items</td>
<td> A six-inch high statuette carved of jade in the likeness of a hugely overweight robed man in the throws of laughter. Once per day, the statuette can be rubbed to immediately cause sapient creatures within a 60-foot radius centred on the statue, with the exception of the creature who rubbed the idol, to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, the creature is suddenly immensely amused and unable to contain their high spirits, becoming both incapacitated and restrained on their next turn following the saving throw.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Simple Bunting</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magical Items</td>
<td> A brightly-colored flag checkered with a diamond-pattern, this seemingly innocuous piece of fabric is both stylish and functional. When worn or attached to a weapon, the bunting creates a chameleon-like effect and coats the clothing of the wearer in an illusionary layer matching the color/pattern of the bunting.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Obsidian Star</td>
<td>Gems</td>
<td> Carved out of jet-black obsidian, this star-shaped gemstone is a wonder to behold. It is always cold to the touch, even when placed in the hottest furnace. Only Dwarves possess the capabilities and knowledge to cut or reshape this precious gemstone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tangled Wire Mesh</td>
<td>Art</td>
<td> It's a bundle of metal bits fused together with heat. That's it. But it's classified as 'art' so I'm sure somebody would be willing to pay a hefty sum for it. It's a shame the artist didn't want to take credit for such a memorable piece.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bell of Bleating</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magical Items</td>
<td> A simple brass bell that is typically found around the neck of a goat. When rung, it mimics the sound of a goat bleating. Become the shepherd you never knew you wanted to be!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Golden Gold-Leaf Leaf</td>
<td>Treasure</td>
<td> An intricate oak leaf cast in gold and covered in micro-thin gold-leaf. The redundancy is real. Don't leaf it behind!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tim's Never-Empty Flask</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magic Item</td>
<td> This unassuming steel flask is always filled with wine, no matter how many swigs you take.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eau de Faerie</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magic Item</td>
<td> This crystal nebulizer with a pink bulb mists a pleasant floral perfume. The scent of the perfume lasts for one hour after application and makes you irresistible to pixies, sprites, and goblins. These creatures can smell you from up to 1,000 feet away and will attempt to touch you, unless you have shown yourself to be a threat to them. Hobgoblins and bugbears can also smell the scent from 1,000 feet away, but they will become furious when they get within 30 feet of you and realize that you are not, in fact, a tasty pixie or sprite.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghoulflesh Scented Candles</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magic Item</td>
<td> When you burn this candle, the smoky odor of roasting ghoulflesh fills the room, ideal for setting the mood for foul necromantic rituals, preparing volunteers for human sacrifice, and all manner of depraved acts involving corpses. The scent sickens any living creature that comes within 30 feet of the candle for 1 minute.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Giant Owl Pellet</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> A giant owl pellet is a disgusting tangle of fur, bones, and feathers. Sometimes, if you dig into it, you can find a few coins that some unfortunate creature may have swallowed or carried, thinking them lucky, only to be, in turn, swallowed by a giant owl. The pellet contains 1d4 - 2 silver pieces and 1d6 - 3 copper pieces, if you take the time to pick through it carefully.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Owlbear Pellet</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> If you thought the giant owl pellet was disgusting, you don't want to know what you might find in an owlbear's pellet.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fire Beetle Glowing Gland</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> This fist-size organ is a little gooey in your hand, but it sheds light like a torch for up to 8 hours after being removed from the beetle.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Crocodile Skin</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> In the right hands, this could make a fine pair of boots.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lizardfolk Skin</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> In the right hands, this could make a fine pair of boots. Be warned: It's best if you tell everyone the boots are crocodiles. Moralizers who are against the wearing of the pelts of sentient creatures have been known to splash wearers of lizardfolk-skin boots with buckets of chicken blood.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Minotaur's Horns</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> Long, thick, with a pointy tip, these horns would look great over your fireplace. Perhaps you could convince that odd little guy who lived down the lane and liked to whittle too much to carve you a nice pair of hunting horns.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Minotaur's Manhood</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> Long, thick, and covered in coarse fur, legends speak of incredibility virility being gifted upon those who eat it. Some swear by it, and I've heard it tastes quite good in a stew with barley and broccoli.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eye of the Necromancer</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> This is the necromancer's eye. He put it out with a hot poker, preserved it by mummification, then animated it with a foul ritual. The eye twitches a bit, but otherwise it doesn't appear to do anything. However, the one-eyed necromancer, wherever he is, can see what the eye sees as if it were still in his head (provided he didn't damage it too badly with the hot poker).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Riv Stecke's Guide to Fey Crossings</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> This book will help you find the nearest fey crossing to make your way into the Feywild. Most of the fey crossings listed have ceased to function due to being over-run with travelers since the publication of this book. However, a few of them still work. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes three days of downtime to read), you have advantage on knowledge checks relating to fey crossings.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bold Alehouse Favorites, by Bob Bayfly</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> This book is a must-have for the cook in any lonesome wayside inn, bustling city tavern, or adventuring party who's sick of rations. Within the pages of the book are new twists on recipes for salted pork and beans, beef and barley stew, roasted duck with apples, honey-glazed carrots and parsnips, stuffed trout fillets and many more, along with suggested ale and mead pairings. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes two days of downtime to read), you have advantage on checks made using cook's utensils.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cosmos-ology, by Cal Sargan</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> A guide to the multiverse written in plain language by one of the leading experts in metaphysics and interplanar travel. Sargan was the greatest communicator among the wizards, priests, sages, and other scholars of his generation who studied the heavens, the stars, and the strange spaces in between. Tragically, he left the world through a portal several decades ago and has not found his way back. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes ten days of downtime to read), you have advantage on knowledge checks relating to the Astral Sea and the Far Realm.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Interview with Some Vampires, by Ena Neric</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> The author spent extensive time meeting with a wide range of known vampires. Her precise question-and-answer style writing has become the definitive work on the subject of these cursed undead. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes three days of downtime to read), you have advantage on knowledge checks relating to the vampires.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Werewolves in the Mist, by Dossia Fyne</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> The author devoted her life to studying the habits of werewolves and other lycanthropes, particularly those who have chosen feral lives far from civilization in the deep forests of the world. Her book is an early voice in the argument against clearing of the forests. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes three days of downtime to read), you have advantage on knowledge checks relating to the lycanthropes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>I Golem, by Isacas Movia</td>
<td>Book</td>
<td> This volume is an extensive treatise on the morality of using golems as enforcers, guardians, and laborers in place of actual sentient beings. The author's thesis: the golem, when properly crafted, animated, and instructed cannot harm its creator. Of course, we know this isn't necessarily true in all cases. The book also contains diagrams and instructions on building your own golem. If you have read this book in the last year (it takes three days of downtime to read), you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks relating to golems.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Robe of Guilt</td>
<td>Clothing</td>
<td> This fine black robe will make you look guilty. When a crime is committed while you are in the room or general area, questioning eyes will turn to accusing eyes as they fall upon you.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Moonfear Shield</td>
<td>Shield</td>
<td> This shiny silver shield is emblazoned with the cycles of the moon, with the full moon largest and nearest the top, surrounded by intricate tree-branch patterns. If during a full moon, a lycanthrope misses you with a melee weapon attack while you are wielding this shield, you can use the opportunity to slip away (you can use your reaction to Disengage [or similar action in other editions]).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Attract Aquatic Creatures</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> This ring is pliant and brightly colored. If you're not careful, you can catch your finger on the sharp steel of one of two barbed hooks that protrude slightly from the soft jiggly material. To use this ring's power, you tie the ring to one end of a piece of string and tie the other end of the string to a stick. With this improvised device, you can catch freshwater fish.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of the Firebuilder</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> This ring is made of flint. When struck with a piece of steel, it sheds sparks. When placed well over dry kindling, the sparks will start a fire.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Bubbles</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> When you hold this ring between two fingers and dip it into a solution of soap and water, you can blow through it to produce amazing bubbles.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Attract Male Creatures</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> This ring, when worn by a female humanoid, makes her irresistible to male humanoids. She will receive unwanted attention, suggestive comments, declarations of affection, and offers for free drinks and places to lie down. Written on the ring in small script is a warning against wearing it around male creatures who have been consuming alcoholic beverages after dark.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Emotional Projection</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> This ring, when worn on the finger of a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher, turns color indicating the wearer's current over-riding emotional state: red indicates anger, yellow indicates joy, blue indicates sadness, green indicates disgust, and purple indicates fear.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Animate Toys</td>
<td>Mostly Useless Magic Item</td>
<td> When the wearer of this ring plays with a child's toy, that toy is granted a semblance of life. The toy can move about, talk, and interact with other toys or humanoids. The toy cannot harm another creature in any way. The toy can answer questions, but it does not know anything other than what a toy could know. One minute after the wearer ceases playing with the toy, the toy returns to it's normal inanimate state.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gideon's Impossible Lantern</td>
<td>Better Than Nothing Magical Item</td>
<td> The lantern that burns water as it is sometimes known. How exactly Archmage Gideon made this lantern is unknown, but it is known that he never needed candles again and saved a fortune in whale oil. Any liquid that fills the lantern will burn as bright as the bearer wishes it to, but will produce no heat.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Phoenix Downs</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> These soft red feathers are obtained the same way as regular downs, such as from a goose or a swan, but at considerably greater risk for considerably greater profit.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Farsight</td>
<td>Joke Magical Item</td>
<td> This pleasantly shiny ring, when turned 3 times about the ring-finger, will show the wearer 5 seconds of what will be happening to their location 3,000 years from now.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Barnaby's Arcane Pulley</td>
<td>Better Than Nothing Magical Item</td>
<td> This resembles a regular pulley with 200ft of thin string attached to it, however the string is magically reinforced, giving it the ability to move up to 1,000lbs when pulled on.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Ring of Solomon</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> Not an item to be trifled with, this item gives the user the ability to command creatures not of this plane. The user must raise the ring to point at the creature in question and speak its words of power, whereupon the creature will fall under the user's command unless it is warded by powerful magic. Unfortunately the words of the ring are lost to the mists of time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gideon's Last Wish</td>
<td>Better Than Nothing Magical Item</td>
<td> The last known relic of Archmage Gideon. This amulet hangs around the user's neck with a minor enchantment on it that makes it slightly uncomfortable to wear, unable to be dispelled. The mechanism by which it activates has never been properly observed, however whenever circumstances are dire it lends its aid in some way that may often go unnoticed. Rumour has it that this is the soul of the vanished Gideon himself bound within the amulet, influencing the world with his powerful magic.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tablet of Yelong</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> The tablet of Yelong was granted to the infamous Warlock by his patron, Orcus. The lord of the undead inscribed it with dark and foreboding runes, that grant whoever holds the tablet the power to raise the dead to fight for him. While Yelong lived no mortal army could destroy him, as with every casualty his forces grew ever stronger. With his death the tablet, untouched by all attempts to destroy it, was sealed in a lead coffin and dropped into the deepest pits of the Underdark.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Duo-Dimension</td>
<td>Joke magical item</td>
<td> Upon wearing this cursed ring, which appears to be a Ring of Protection, the character becomes two-dimensional. Their depth is placed on the Astral Plane and they become a 2D being with only width and bredth. From the side they are totally invisible and they can squeeze through any gap without expending additional movement, and are especially vulnerable to being pierced or cut.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>High Elf Pipeweed</td>
<td>They call 'em High Elves for a reason</td>
<td> Commonly burned in the forest courts High Elf Pipeweed is a type of hemp impregnated with the deep magic of the Feywild. When the smoke from burning it in a magical fire is inhaled it may give magical visions of the future or the past, and as such is favored by oracles and soothsayers. Under the effects of antimagic it merely produces a light-headed feeling and a desire to eat apples.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Darkspice</td>
<td>Supplies</td>
<td> One of the world's most valuable commodities, Darkspice produces a subtle, smokey flavour and a slow-burning heat that is highly prized by gourmets the world over. With the only source for this spice being the caves beneath tropical zones a handful can be worth enough money to keep a man living comfortably for life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bloodsoup</td>
<td>Supplies</td>
<td> The stable of Orcish "cuisine" this bitter vegetable soup apparently tastes like nothing to their palette. Experiments with Half-Orcs have thus far been inconclusive. The main ingredient is bloodgrass and other herbs, along with small amounts of meat. A single waterskin's worth of Bloodsoup can feed an Orc for two days, and it provides a great deal of nourishment for armies on the campaign trail relative to the cost to produce.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Jib Cutter</td>
<td>Joke Magical Item</td>
<td> This glittering steel knife, with a jeweled golden hilt, is the bane of dandies everywhere. Upon falling into your hands you become blithe and insensitive, forced to say the first thing that comes into your head in conversation.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cormac's Kilt of Holding</td>
<td>Just what does he keep under there?</td>
<td> Fashioned carefully from two Bags of Holding by the Druid Cormac some time ago, the kilt of holding can be worn just like a regular kilt. But as long as the wearer is wearing nothing else underneath it it functions in the same way as a Bag of Holding.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>rules</td>
<td>man!</td>
<td> Similar to a Horn of Valhalla this horn summons a large group of Orcs in place of the regular human berserkers. However they have no proficiency with weapons or armor, and instead carry instruments and dancing shoes with which they will stage a production. There are four different types of horn that produce different types of performance:</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Household Staff</td>
<td>Better Than Nothing Magical Item</td>
<td> When placed at the centre of a house or mansion with adjacent lands of no less than 5 miles this staff will summon enough Unseen Servants to perform every rudimentary task that needs doing. Cleaning, cooking delicious meals, gardening, slipper fetching etc will all be done by the servants punctually and efficiently. However they will not follow orders from the owner and will continue their tasks until the staff is moved.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Chronicles of Theodoro Slavado</td>
<td>Information</td>
<td> Salvado was/is an explorer hired by many influential nobles to map different areas of the world. As such his notes contain detailed descriptions of each place he visited, along with the important figures and the local customs and culture. Salvado's current whereabouts are unknown, the last the was heard of him was just before he voyage to investigate the Cannibal Islands, claiming that "The name can't be that literal."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Valaran's Ring</td>
<td>Magical Item</td>
<td> Valaran wandered the earth, a prophet to some, an omen of doom to others. Wither he walked he would not say. Some claim he was lost and seeking something that befuddled even him, others that he had seen some vision of a dark future he must prevent, others say he wanders still and is wandering for its own sake. Valaran's ring is named in his honor, though it was worn by men before him and he predicted it would have a thousand masters after he gave it away. When wearing the ring the bearer need only speak the name of their destination and they will be guided there inexorably, led down forgotten paths and routes that offer the quickest travel with the least danger.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dahrruin's Bow</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> Dahrruin, son of Setenan of the Lancathan Dynasty was a prince of Elvenkind who could shoot another arrow from the sky with his own, or so it was claimed. This bow bears a special affinity for Elves and when wielded by one they may fire arrows with it without being seen and with unerring accuracy, as they whisper through the air to find the throats of enemies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Crown of the Sunken King</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> A relic of the Sunken City of Hellionsberg, as long as the user is standing waist-deep in salty water the city's portal to the Elemental Plane of Water will disgorge three water elementals every hour that will obey all the user's commands.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flint & Steel</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> Flint is a greatsword that is a dark, shiny black like polished flint, with a curious and vaguely cruciform groove in the pommel that runs up and onto the blade. When wielded alone it will be nothing more than ordinary. Steel is a shortsword that shines like silver polished to a mirror sheen, imbued with magical properties it will shock living flesh with sparks of electricity when brought into contact with it. When combined the purpose of Flint's groove is made obvious, as Steel fits securely into it and cannot be removed except by the one who is attuned to Flint. When the two combined strike anything flames are produced that will burn the target.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sarcophagus of the Ancestors</td>
<td>Potentially Useful Magical Item</td>
<td> While a character lies in the Sarcophagus of the Ancestors without illumination and the lid tightly sealed they may speak to their ancestors. No sound from within the sarcophagus may escape into the outside world and the lid is too heavy to lift from the inside.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spud Gun</td>
<td>Better than Nothing Magical Items</td>
<td> No ammunition is required, as this strange cylindrical device reloads itself, presumably from the Elemental Plane of Potato. Range: 30/120 feet Damage: 1 + DEX bludgeoning damage (Unless proficient in Food Fighting, then 1d6 + DEX) Properties: Two-handed, Ranged</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stormplate</td>
<td>Armour</td>
<td> Wrought in bright steel, this ornate (+1) plate armour has lightning bolt patterns raised from its surface in blue-burnished metal. Other symbols and icons of the Storm Spirits also decorate the armour, and are included on the buckles and clasps. Once per short/long rest, the wearer may, when hit by a melee attack, cause the attacking creature to take 1d8 lightning damage (1d12 if the wearer is associated with the spirits of the storm) as a reaction.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Golden Pseudodragon Statue</td>
<td>Art</td>
<td> This lifesize golden statue of a pseudodragon is perfect in its detail. The creature is captured, almost photographically, rising on its hind legs, neck outstretched, as if to greet some friendly hand which is in turn reaching out to stroke its reptilian head. Such quality, finesse, and attention to detail is unheard of in modern casting methods, and were it not so preposterous a concept, one could be forgiven for thinking that it might be a living being, cursed by some unknown magics in the distant past.</td>

<td> This is, to all intents and porpoises, a Decanter of Endless Water, with one small variation - it seems to be a child's toy, which produces only a small squirt of water when squeezed. If this is truly a childs toy, then what does that tell us of the power of the ancient civilisation that created it? And why did it find itself in such a dark and terrible place as where it was found?</td>

<td>Dice Tower of Fortune</td>
<td>Meta-Magic Item</td>
<td> This short rod is assembled from a series of regular polygons, with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 sides respectively. You can use one of the dice to achieve the maximum roll of that dice type when one is rolled during the game. In doing so, the corresponding dice vanishes from the block. This is intended to be something that you might even make (from cheap dice and blu-tak, perhaps?) and hand to the player who loots it. It will appear, in-game, to be a simple object, albeit one with a faintly magical aura. Once attuned to the object, the character learns that they can call on its power when in need. I called "meta-magic item" because it's sort of in the boundary between player and character, if that makes any sense.</td>

<td>Great Axe of the Betrayed</td>
<td>Magical Weapon</td>
<td> Ummm guys.... I got carried away. This axe is always covered with tacky almost dried blood. Even when cleaned the blood always returns. The axe itself has a bad history of betrayal and vengeance which lead to it gaining powers. The axe was originally forged by an elven smith living in a human city along with other weapons. The smith was to forge "100 pounds of good steel" to pay off his gambling debt. The holder of said debt found many "problems" with the expertly crafted steel and kept the elf in servitude for months after the debt was paid. The next instance of betrayal was against the man holding the debt, though he may have deserved it the betrayer had no way of knowing that. A half elf merchant and his men bought the steel in bulk all of the elves work after the forgemaster had been freed. They paid in enchanted copper coins, The holder of the dept was hanged when he paid his taxes in fake gold coins. The Half elf and his men traveled south hoping to trade their ill gotten gains and found the road had been blocked by a tribe of gnolls. A gnome and his band offered to help but only if he got half payment now and the other half when the job was done. This did not end well for the half elf whom paid in a crate of his wares. The gnome returned and said the road was safe and his men would guard the caravan until it reached the town past the plains. He was lying of course and had given the gnolls the crate of weapons in exchange for their help slaughtering the half elf and his men. The gnolls promised the gnome the wealth in exchange for the weapons. They lied too. The gnolls left the scene with all of it including the weapon that would later be called the Axe of the Betrayed. The gnolls lived in a strict matriarchy and the gnoll whom acquired the axe was the brother of the reigning matriarch. Given only select females were allowed to breed any offspring from any non sanctioned unions would be eliminated. A warrior female and the brother to the chief had one such union. He promised to keep the child safe. His weak will saw that the matriarch found out about the child and forced her brother to accompany her as she tracked the mother down. She ran for days but eventually the matriarch and her pathetic sibling caught up with her. On the rocky plains she gave her child to a band of adventurers moments before the Axe of the Betrayed was thrown into her back by her former lover. She died from the wound but not before seeing the confused half orc hand her child over to the matriarch. She watched as it was killed. The axe was left in her back but she would not stay dead. She arose as a Revenant the next night and buried her pup properly. Using her new undead powers the gnoll mother destroyed her former tribe and tracked the band of adventurers in the southern swamps. She was destroyed and her axe taken. Though she still seeks vengeance the Axe has found new owners. The axe itself is magical now and where as it was used to cause great suffering and betrayal the powers that inhabit it seek to right wrongs instead. The axe becomes a +1 weapon against any foe who has attacked a companion of its wielder. This bonus also is gained if the wielder has seen the target harm an innocent. The axe deals 2d12 instead of 1d12 if a companion is reduced to 0 hit points but only on the wielders next turn and on the target causing the damage. (once per turn) If the wielder is seeking to bring justice to a betrayer the axes power truly shines. If the wielder can recount aloud the betrayal the target has caused in combat the next hit the axe lands on the target is automatically a critical.</td>

<td>Gravedigger's Lamp</td>
<td>Magic Item</td>
<td> The glass around the lamp is cloudy and cracked, and any candle placed inside gives only a pitifully weak glow. However, if the lantern is placed somewhere which rarely sees natural light, such as a cave or crypt, the candle will start to burn low. As it burns out, everyone present gently falls asleep. They awaken in the Shadowfell. Also, everyone bathed in the lantern's light while in Shadowfell seems as if they belong and automatically pass Disguise (but not Impersonation) checks.</td>

<td>Necromancer's Hand</td>

<td> A simple ring, found on a dismembered, rotting hand in the mud somewhere. While worn, user can cast Mage Hand as a cantrip, but it takes two actions to do so. Also, after every use, the user's hand and arm become rotten and skeletal (including armor and clothing), like the arm of undead. The effect eventually fades, but it takes longer and longer each time. Use this too much, and it'll spread to the rest of the body. If it reaches the body, the bearer dies and becomes undead (but still sentient!)</td>

<td>Dragon Powder</td>
<td>Creature Bits</td>
<td> In spite of its name, this highly combustible powder is not harvested from dragons, but rather several species of fire breathing wyverns. Consisting of rapidly decayed poison as was only recently discovered through research into the evolution of these species, the powder is excreted through the mouth, where the creature's saliva protects it from the adverse effects. When kept most, the outer layer of a ball of the powder will become crusted and hard. When consequently broken open against a solid surface, the resulting explosion created by the expanding and combusting powder will deal mainly force damage to all in the area. Due to the difficulty of harvesting and storing the powder safely the select few that purchase it do so at a high price. While unconfirmed, several wizards have stated that using the powder as the material component for the "fireball" spell is not only possible, but also greatly enhances it's effects.</td>

<td> This wickedly sharp spear has a shaft of dark grey metal with an unpleasant oily sheen. The stuff of shadows constantly coalesces and drips from the tip of the spear. If the spear even scratches an enemy, this dark essence can be used to form a necromantic link between the wielder and the victim. Once per long rest, the wielder of this weapon may activate its special property after successfully striking a target with the spear. Until the end of the encounter, whenever the wielder of the spiteful spear takes damage the target also takes 2 points of damage. This damage is of the same damage type as the attack on the wielder.</td>

<td>Sazaran's Spice Rack</td>
<td>Tools / Supplies</td>
<td> A small wooden rack that, curiously, only has room for one jar. The jar that comes with this rack is empty. Away from the rack the jar is completely ordinary, it is merely a receptacle for the magic of the rack. To use the power of the spice rack, the lid of the jar must be removed and any spice or edible herb named. The jar immediately fills with the named flavouring. The contents are enough to flavour a single meal for up to ten people. Naming a second spice or herb replaces the contents. Spices and herbs already named can be re-summoned but the amount in the jar will be reduced by the amount previously used. The capacity of the jar for each spice or herb refills after a long rest. No matter the amount used, no flavouring created by the spice rack has the capacity to poison, even if it normally would when ingested in large doses. The spice rack simply cannot create any herb which is inedible. A person may be attuned to this item; if so attuned they can use the spice rack for its real purpose: effectively, an innocuous poisoner's kit. The attuned rack will happily create poisonous herbs for its owner, and any edible herb that is actually poisonous in high doses is now no longer safe when ingested in large amounts.</td>

It will tell the character where to find gold using (Wisdom) Perception checks. It won't rest until it has obtained new gold every day.

<td>The Sword of Bawking</td>

<td> The Sword of Bawking is best presented among many seemingly normal chickens. It begins as a simple chicken that appears nothing more than dinner. However, when it senses danger for the person who last fed it, it hops up and transforms into a powerful sword. Its head becomes the pommel, its neck the grip, its wings the guard, and its legs fuse to become the long blade. It functions as a (insert enchantment level) longsword until all the danger is dispelled, at which point it turns into a normal chicken once more and acts as if nothing ever happened. If bred with another of its species, it's chicks will transform into daggers in the same manner.</td>

<td>Better than nothing magical item</td>
<td> These beautiful calf-skin boots were crafted by a leatherworker named Corneli for his love Adele, to aid her in her lengthy pilgrimage to The Holy Rock. For many weeks on end he worked, weaving subtle magic between and among his stitches. Once the shining brass buckles are secured, the wearer of these boots will never tire from traveling on foot. The boots do not dirty from the dust of the road, nor do they ever seem to wear out. However, before he gave the boots to Adele, Corneli's jealous rival, the Enchanter Aneu, cursed them with a dread bewitchment. Whenever the wearer attempts to move at a faster pace than a walk, the buckles will come unclasped, causing them to stumble and fall. Corneli - who knew nothing of the curse - gave the boots to Adele on the day of her departure. The two lovers took a bit too long saying their goodbyes, and so she was forced to hurry to catch up with the other pilgrims. As she ran across the Red River Bridge, Aneu's enchantment took effect, and she fell off into the water and drowned. Corneli was heartbroken, and buried Adele's body by the bridge where she died. He never forgave himself for what he thought was his own failure. He threw the boots into the river, and vowed to never work magic ever again.</td>

The stick stays at that length for 8 hours unless collapsed by the person who extended it. The stick can only grow to whole number lengths, from 1-10 foot. Attempting to grow half sizes requires a dc 10 check with no modifiers. Can be used once per day, recharges at dawn. Can be made to grow larger than 10' but with increasing difficulty at dm's discretion. No matter what size it is, if used as a weapon only ever deals 1hp damage as it is still a stick. If the stick is broken it breaks with a large crack that will deafen anyone within ten feet for 1d4 rounds, and is thereafter rendered useless as anything other than a broken stick. If burnt the stick releases a purple flame.</td>

The wearer of the glove can expend a charge by saying the command word while touching a liquid container with the gloved hand. Once they do so, the glove begins to glow faintly and the patterns shift across the glove’s surface. The wearer then holds a palm-sized comestible (or several of the same comestibles in an equivalent volume) in the gloved hand and squeezes. The glove destroys the food and creates juice which streams lazily through the air into the designated container. A single charge can create up to 4 pints of juice, but it will never create more than the selected container can hold.</td>

<td>Staff of the Time Magus</td>
<td>Powerful Magical Item</td>
<td> This oak staff clutches a sapphire at its tip and is otherwise a perfectly normal, if knobbled and twisted, staff. It contains 2d6 charges, one of which may be expended as a bonus action to weave fates together. When a charge is used after casting a spell that requires a saving throw with the staff as an arcane focus all forms of advantage are cancelled and all targets have disadvantage on their saving throw. Legendary Resistance may still be used. If all charges on the staff are expended then it shatters and it is destroyed at all points in its timeline, which is convoluted and strange, it reforms three months later at all points along its timeline. Due to the convoluted nature of time with the staff there may be multiple versions of the staff in existence at the same time, which will instantly shatter if touched together. In order to permanently destroy the staff some way must be found to seclude two of them from the stream of time and then touch them together. This will mark the end of the timeline of the staff and it may not exist after that point.</td>

So, let's make some loot! The loot doesn't necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase as an accessory to their equipment or wardrobe. These should be mostly mechanics I'll post a few examples.</td>

Anyone who holds this censer can also spin it around by the chain and whack a foe with it (it functions as a flail when used as a melee weapon).</td>

<td>Ring of Ceremony Storing</td>
<td>Magical Ring</td>
<td> This ring functions much like a Ring of Storing, but instead of magically storing and recalling a weapon, you instead store the items (ie, candles, censer, small altar, etc.) needed for a specific ceremony (ie, marriage, funeral, bar mitzvah, etc.), and can summon them at a moments notice. The ring is reusable and can store the ceremonial items again after the ceremony is completed. Items stored in the ring stay in the ring even when the ring is removed, so a single priest may carry a number of these rings, one for each ceremony they feel they may have to perform during their journeys. So, if one of these rings is found in a treasure, or on a dead body, there is a good chance there may already be ceremonial items stored within. But, fair warning, these rings can be used by priests of any belief (good, neutral, evil.), so activating this ring may cause the wearer to find themselves surrounded with unholy or holy items, which could be detrimental to one's health if of an opposing belief.</td>

<td> A traveling Holy Person can see their items receive lots of wear and tear along the way, and books are often known for not being the sturdiest of items, since they can get water damaged, burnt, torn, in addition to many other ways they can be defaced or destroyed. So, the Indestructible Prayer Book was created to help traveling clerics, healers, and other holy types not have to worry about such things. The book is waterproof, flameproof, and tear proof. And the pages are illuminated with a soft light, so one could even read the book in the darkest of places. Plus, as an added bonus, if you tell it what prayer you're looking for specifically. it will open to that prayer by itself, so you don't have to fumble with pages while performing a ceremony. Admittedly these books are expensive, which is why they are usually reserved for the upper echelons of the church, but they are sometimes gifted to special priests as rewards for some great deed performed for the church.</td>

To avoid her fate in his harem, she concocted a vial that could bring death temporarily, only long enough to escape her peril. It is now sold as a prayer item, immortalizing innocence and occasionally used to get out of a bind.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>SinStones</td>
<td>Magical Item</td>
<td> The SinStones are remnants found in a temple to an ancient religion, which believed that all sins were evil. The stone glows warm when it is touching the skin of a man or woman who has committed the specific sin the stone is attuned to. Unfortunately, the more useful SinStones, such as the MurderStone and the TheftStone have been found and hoarded by nobles. The only stones that one would still encounter in the wild are decidedly less useful, and reflect the values of the ancient religion. Example Stone: The AdulteryStone, the UsuryStone, the RacismStone, and others that are only mildly or situationally useful.</td>
