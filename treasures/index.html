<td>What sorts of goodies do we find?</td>
<td>After prying the brass ring off his finger, you rifle through the cultist's robes (he sure had a lot of pockets). You find a pocketbook of daily devotions, some prayer beads that look to be carved of teeth, and a few coins of foreign make...</td>
<td> Between unholy dungeons, demons, devils, resurrections, and chosen ones, I seem to have stumbled into a semi-religious theme. Naturally, that has me thinking about the kind of loot that one might find in a temple or shrine, carried by a cultist, or peddled by a wandering priest or vendor on the steps of the temple. So, let's make some loot! The loot doesn't necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase as an accessory to their equipment or wardrobe. These should be mostly mechanics free. I'll post a few examples.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bracelet of Sleeplessness</td>
<td>Meditation Beads</td>
<td> This bracelet, created by a monk who's name has been lost to antiquity, consists of 10 translucent white beads. Using the bracelet grants the user the ability to meditate for 10 minutes and gain the benefits of a short rest at which point one of the beads turns black and cannot be used again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tome of Insults</td>
<td>Uncommon Book</td>
<td> This book of jabs and insults is believed to have been created by a trickster god who was attempting to get under the skin of his far more serious brother. It is filled to the brim with insults, jabs, and jokes at the expense of the person, creature, or god that the user is targeting. The insults seem to have no magical affect but can be a bit disheartening to the butt of the joke.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Censer of Nightmares</td>
<td>Rare Magical Trinket</td>
<td> Found in the ruins of a long-dissolved (or fried, frozen, burned or vaporized) dragon cult, the censer is a silvered vessel, supported by a length of finely worked dark iron chain. It seems to radiate black smoke when not looked at directly, but on closer inspection seems inert. Any incense burned in the censer is many times more pungent than it would be otherwise, and seems to cause dizziness and disorientation.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ummon's Deed</td>
<td>Unique Document</td>
<td> On her (un)deathbed, the Archlich Ummon bequeathed all that she owned in (un)life to the only man she'd ever loved - a cleric in the local non-denominational parish - forgetting that she had killed him almost two centuries before. Having no survivors (that the county solicitor could be bothered to find), the inheritance fell to the church itself, and the elderly old Dwarf who presided there. Now encased in glass (and lead, to be safe), the ornately illustrated deed sits in the church's northern apse, waiting for someone courageous enough to discover what, exactly, the Archlich's estate consists of.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thief-Catching Rope</td>
<td>Belt</td>
<td> the DC to pickpocket you is raise by 10, and if the pickpocket fails, the rope will make a combat maneuver against it to bind its hands and legs together, with a DC of 15 (12-15 = just ties hands); If used as a belt, the Rope makes the combat maneuver regardless of pickpocket success (as long as it can see or hear the hand)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Unimaginable Orb</td>
<td>Trinket</td>
<td> durable metal orb that cannot be scried, detected, or in any way sensed other than with one's own eyes, ears, touch, smell, or taste (such that seeing through others' eyes will have it be invisible, and you cannot imagine what it looks like once out of sight, though is recognizable on sight); world's worst object to lose</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bag of Ham Sandwiches</td>
<td>Bag</td>
<td> Small pouch which turns any object placed inside into a ham sandwich; the pouch must be able to close to turn it into a sandwich</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Babble Stone</td>
<td>Rock</td>
<td> If a stone is in your pockets, hand, or on your immediate person, it causes all speech to become gibberish; a fun thing to sleight of hand it into someone's pocket</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rabble Rubble</td>
<td>Rock</td>
<td> If a stone is in your pockets, hand, or on your immediate person, it causes you to trail off into different conversations, compulsively; a fun thing to sleight of hand it into someone's pocket</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rebel Pebble</td>
<td>Rock</td>
<td> If a stone is in your pockets, hand, or on your immediate person, it causes all speech to become defensive and antagonistic; a fun thing to sleight of hand it into someone's pocket</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Traveling Tankard</td>
<td>Mug</td>
<td> when held, pulls towards the nearest tavern. If hasn't been held in long enough, the handle turns into a pair of legs, and walks to the nearest tavern</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bean of Autocoquere</td>
<td>Morbid Vegetable</td>
<td> When fed to a dead animal of less than 1 CR, the animal's corpse will briefly animate and use any means at hand to cook and prepare itself into a meal for up to 4 people.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Madman's Blanket</td>
<td>Blanket</td>
<td> Anyone sleeping under this blanket will have horrible, maddening nightmares.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Manifesto of Manipulation</td>
<td>Devious Folio</td>
<td> Covered in elaborate script. All attempts at translating will fail, but leaves translator sure they are close to cracking it. Has an air of great worth, will always appraise high. Catches on fire if within 3' of an open flame, burns bright, but is never consumed or otherwise damaged by flame.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Whimsycube</td>
<td>Cube of Whimsy</td>
<td> the whimsycube beeps when it is near something it wants; it wants random things, and when it is in sight of the thing, it will fly to it quickly, and absorb it, leaving behind something; can swallow a marble and leave a chair, can swallow a chair and leave an artifact, can swallow an artifact and leave a chair</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Charles</td>
<td>Figurine</td>
<td> This small, unremarkable figurine of a gnome refuses to be called anything but Charles. No other name will leave the lips of the speaker. It has no other powers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bauble of Gnome-Peeping</td>
<td>Orb</td>
<td> A crystal scrying ball that is dedicated to a specific gnome in the world and, when the command word is spoken, shows a third-person view and muffled audio of the gnome; upon gnome death, the bauble randomly selects a new gnome in the world (not random, has logic to it, but the logic is complicated and unknown)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fork of Greater Poultry</td>
<td>Four-Tined Utensil</td>
<td> Anything eaten with this fork tastes like chicken.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Orb, the Horse</td>
<td>Orb</td>
<td> A sentient globe that insists that it is a horse. A perfect sphere, two feet in diameter, hovers one foot above the ground. Can be mounted and moves faster than any horse, but every turn you must make a DC 10 dex check or slip off, potentially taking damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>String of Lots</td>
<td>Prayer beads</td>
<td> When created, these beads consist of a dozen or so colorless pearls. If a tear of sorrow touches a bead, it turns a deep shade of blue forever; similarly, a tear of joy turns the pearl golden. The acolyte is supposed to alternate blue and golden pearls through his/her life, so that he/she will always remember while praying that sorrow must follow joy and joy must follow sorrow.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Periapt of Proof Against the Flesh</td>
<td>Talisman</td>
<td> This periapt protects the user from worldly desires. While it's worn, food and drink taste bland and the user becomes sexually apathetic.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mirror of Recollection</td>
<td>Trinket</td>
<td> This is an ornate vanity mirror with details in gold. While holding it, the user may focus on a person's name that he/she has personally met. An image of what that person looked like when the user first met will appear on the mirror.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>String of Carved Dragon Teeth</td>
<td>Prayer beads</td>
<td> Dragon teeth make popular prayer beads among certain death cults. Particularly among cultists who wish to meet death in spectacular fashion as dragons are often infuriated at the site of these grisly relics.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>String of Etched Human Teeth</td>
<td>Prayer beads</td>
<td> A popular focus for prayers among flesh cults, these little beads get smoother over time as fingers rub them repeatedly during devotions several times daily. Tiny evil runes are often etched into the teeth. On old sets of beads, the etching may need to be touched up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Amulet of Protection against Possession</td>
<td>Questionably enchanted item</td>
<td> This heart-shaped talisman contains a giant heart-shaped ruby that seems to glow when it catches the light. The talisman is attached to a gold chain to be worn about the neck. Allegedly this item will protect the wearer from ghostly and demonic possession. However, it is well-known that wearing this item will attract dragons and greedy dwarves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Splinter-Sect Pocketbook of Sacred Rites</td>
<td>Book of prayers and rituals</td>
<td> This book covers the basic procedures involved in most sacred rites: naming babies, welcoming to adulthood, marrying two people, easing the passing of the dead, and expelling demons. Unfortunately, it describes the practices for a faith other than your own. If you have this book on hand when you are about to perform one of these rituals, you can spend 10 minutes browsing the book. After which, you roll a d20. On a roll of 18 or higher, you gain advantage on the first ability check made in the performance of the ritual (having reminded yourself of a helpful tip). On a natural roll of 1, you gain disadvantage on the first ability check made in the performance of the ritual (having spoken an improper word for your faith).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Death Coins</td>
<td>Religious paraphernalia</td>
<td> A pair of tarnished, over-sized copper coins often used to cover the eyes of the dead. A pair of these can be used as a holy symbol by a cleric who worships a deity associated with the death domain or as an arcane focus by a necromancer. If melted down, each coins yields enough copper to make 100 + d100 copper pieces.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Brass Censer</td>
<td>Religious paraphernalia</td>
<td> A basket-shaped device on a chain that can safely hold a hot coal to burn incense during sacred rituals. The outer plating contains etched images and icons of a well-known god. This can be use as a holy symbol by clerics who worship a deity associated with the fire domain or as an arcane focus by a pyromancer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>War Censer</td>
<td>Religious paraphernalia</td>
<td> From the exterior this censer appears much like any other brass censer used to burn incense in holy rites. Heavier than a normal censer, and reinforced with a steel frame and fortifying spells, clerics who worship a deity associated with the fire domain or the war domain can use this censer as a holy symbol. Anyone who holds this censer can also spin it around by the chain and whack a foe with it (it functions as a flail when used as a melee weapon).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ring of Ceremony Storing</td>
<td>Magical Ring</td>
<td> This ring functions much like a Ring of Storing, but instead of magically storing and recalling a weapon, you instead store the items (ie, candles, censer, small altar, etc.) needed for a specific ceremony (ie, marriage, funeral, bar mitzvah, etc.), and can summon them at a moments notice. The ring is reusable and can store the ceremonial items again after the ceremony is completed. Items stored in the ring stay in the ring even when the ring is removed, so a single priest may carry a number of these rings, one for each ceremony they feel they may have to perform during their journeys. So, if one of these rings is found in a treasure, or on a dead body, there is a good chance there may already be ceremonial items stored within. But, fair warning, these rings can be used by priests of any belief (good, neutral, evil.), so activating this ring may cause the wearer to find themselves surrounded with unholy or holy items, which could be detrimental to one's health if of an opposing belief.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Vanity</td>
<td>Doorknow</td>
<td> Must be polished before you may enter</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Ill-Manners</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> It just looks like a hand and you will have to shake hands to open it. But when the door is open, it won't let go. You need a strenght check to pull yourself free or you'll need to cut the hand off risking to hurt the one who is shaking hands.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Unison Knob</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> Pair that always open and close in unison. If you can open door A, it will force open door B. If you can keep door A closed, door B will stay closed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Nope</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> Door knob is shy, and doesn't like to be touched. Moves around the door trying to avoid getting grabbed. Can be sweet talked, but only trusts [guys|girls]. If you grab it unwillingly it will scream for an adult, that you aren't it's real owner, and anything else it can think of to get you to leave it alone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>No-Soliciting Knob</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> Retracts into door and can't be turned during certain times/certain people//certain race/unless you sing/unless someone brought ice cream.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Rob</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> As you open it, anyone walking through and near the door must make a DC 11 perception check to detect having your pocket picked; those behind you don't get an automatic check, but should they roll in suspicion of the door, the DC is 6; before robbed, hand is out and open, after, in and closed</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Envy</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> Attempts to charm person holding it into loving it</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Vulgarity</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> moans with pleasure and won't open until you swear at it</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knob of Rotation Displacement</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> when you attempt to turn the doorknob, something else nearby turns instead (i.e. a nose, a boob, a backpack)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spring-Spike Knob</td>
<td>Doorknob</td>
<td> when fully turned, juts a spike into the hand, dealing piercing damage</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Meteoric Domino</td>
<td>Game Piece</td>
<td> A legendary domino that upon falling, demands that all in the enclosed space hear it fall, no matter how big the open space is nor how loud a noise there is in the background (if outside, everything with a soul or life/unlife hears it in the universe)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Toothy Mirror</td>
<td>Standing Mirror</td>
<td> all whose entire image is caught in the mirror provokes it to eat their reflection, requiring a DC 15 Charisma save to resist having their reflection devoured permanently, removing their reflection as the Curse of the Devoured, for a permanent -1 to Charisma</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frog Box</td>
<td>Small Treasure Box</td>
<td> If this box is left open near a frog, it’ll be compelled to hop in and sit there happily. The frog will stay in the box – and need no food, air or water – until instructed to hop out</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Whistling Whacking Whetstone</td>
<td>Rock</td>
<td> DC 10 charisma save to resist being forced to "hw" your "wh"s while in possession; always hits as a projectile</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Indestructible Prayer Book</td>
<td>Prayer Book</td>
<td> A traveling Holy Person can see their items receive lots of wear and tear along the way, and books are often known for not being the sturdiest of items, since they can get water damaged, burnt, torn, in addition to many other ways they can be defaced or destroyed. So, the Indestructible Prayer Book was created to help traveling clerics, healers, and other holy types not have to worry about such things. The book is waterproof, flameproof, and tear proof. And the pages are illuminated with a soft light, so one could even read the book in the darkest of places. Plus, as an added bonus, if you tell it what prayer you're looking for specifically. it will open to that prayer by itself, so you don't have to fumble with pages while performing a ceremony. Admittedly these books are expensive, which is why they are usually reserved for the upper echelons of the church, but they are sometimes gifted to special priests as rewards for some great deed performed for the church.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Elixir of Feign Death</td>
<td>Potion</td>
<td> It is said that many millennium ago there lived a priestess whose beauty surpassed the god's. Men fell quickly at her feet, but none so much as an old wretched king. To avoid her fate in his harem, she concocted a vial that could bring death temporarily, only long enough to escape her peril. It is now sold as a prayer item, immortalizing innocence and occasionally used to get out of a bind.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The All-Seeing Cauldron</td>
<td>Mundane</td>
<td> A copper cauldron carved with eyes on the outside, and teeth on the inside. Food prepared in it has a metallic tang that tastes more of iron or blood than of copper.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Morpho's Box</td>
<td>Barely Magic Item</td>
<td> The ornate cedar box covered in layered scraps of pink, green, and teal silk has a slight preservation enchantment on it that keeps all insects placed into it in stasis. The priest of this ancient temple used it to collect butterflies and release them during his sermons for emotional effect. The box currently contains a stunning, fist-sized, Blue Morpho butterfly. A less moral adventurer could use this to keep a venomous insect hidden.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Father Gregor's Spoon</td>
<td>Mundane Item</td>
<td> This spoon is made out of a dried gourd, and is carved with the emblem of a baobab tree, the seal of monk and gourd carver Father Gregor. This spoon is not magical at all, but rumors state that any liquid sipped with it will taste sweet like honey.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Satchel of Hair</td>
<td>Mundane Item</td>
<td> A rural offshoot of the church of Kord states that a man's strength is held in his hair. This church collected hair from men who willingly sacrificed their strength to their god. These offerings sit in a well-made leather satchel that contains hair of every length and color, from cirrus-colored wisps of septuagenarian hair, to the most luxuriant and lengthy hair fibers of an elven lad.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>SinStones</td>
<td>Magical Item</td>
<td> The SinStones are remnants found in a temple to an ancient religion, which believed that all sins were evil. The stone glows warm when it is touching the skin of a man or woman who has committed the specific sin the stone is attuned to. Unfortunately, the more useful SinStones, such as the MurderStone and the TheftStone have been found and hoarded by nobles. The only stones that one would still encounter in the wild are decidedly less useful, and reflect the values of the ancient religion. Example Stone: The AdulteryStone, the UsuryStone, the RacismStone, and others that are only mildly or situationally useful.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Three Ring's of Orin</td>
<td>Bind</td>
<td> A talisman constructed from rings of copper, iron, and silver forming a sphere. The original Talisman was constructed by a wizard named Orin Ogden the founder of the Unbroken Circle a group of mages that combat abberation and extraplanar entities on the material plane. The talisman can produce three different magical effects on command. Only one effect can be active at a time and the Three Ring's of Orin has 6 charges, 1d4+1 charges are renewed at dawn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Potion of social Tabula Rasa</td>
<td>potion</td>
<td> A rare potion commissioned by a diplomat centuries ago to wipe clean his relationship with a foreign King who he had accidentally gravely insulted. After consuming the potion all past social encounters with the first person he or she sees will magically seem hazy and forgotten, essentially treating the first person seen as someone they just met for the first time. The drinker does not forget past interactions, but the events seem faint and no longer hold any away on the opinion of the person. Useful as a reset button in relations with someone else, but also has mischievous possibilities. The drink looks, smells, and tastes exactly like red wine.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pearls of Piety</td>
<td>Prayer Beads</td>
<td> This string of large pearl-like stones radiate with light and warmth when the holder's prayers are heard by their deity. There is no guarantee that the prayer will be answered, however.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tome of Remembrance</td>
<td>Prayer Book</td>
<td> This small, leather-bound book is created empty, each page filling with the prayers of it's owner as they are are offered to their god. The owner of this tome should be careful that their less-than-pious prayers and wishes may be recorded as well.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A Dragon's Delicate Diet</td>
<td>Trinket</td>
<td> This fist-sized kidney stone is said to have been passed by a dragon of delicate disposition. When held over a meal, the stone will weep a thick fluid if the food contains ingredients that may cause the holder digestive distress.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Plynic's Book of Prophecy</td>
<td>Prayer Book</td>
<td> A fairly simple leather-bound book filled to the brim with the hand-written history of the Church of Bahamut written inside, in Draconic. It belonged to a dragonborn cleric of Bahamut, Plynic Loremark, who was convinced that coded in the text was an ancient prophecy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Book of Fel Names</td>
<td>Rare Grimoire</td>
<td> Edit: that spell doesn't exist in 5e.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Beads of Lathander</td>
<td>Prayer Beads</td>
<td> A string of 28 round, yellow, glass beads approximately the size of a marble, strung on an oiled thread. Each day, one of the beads lights up in the morning just before dawn, then stays lit through the day. At the end of the month, the sequence starts again. If a bead is removed, it continues to light for the day once per month. Another clear bead of glass added to the string will turn yellow 24 hours after it is added and begin to light on the day where it appears in the sequence. If there are more than 28 beads, the others will turn yellow, but won't glow on a day, unless they're in the first 28 on the string.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chausable of Radiance</td>
<td>Magical Vestment</td>
<td> The chausable is a round fabric with a hole in the center for the head, which drapes to the waist, and which forms a semicircle when arms are raised to the sides as seen from the front or back. This chausable glows faintly when worn by a cleric, and when the arms are raised, radiates a bright light for 20' and a faint light for 40'.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stole of Thaumaturgy</td>
<td>Magical Vestment</td>
<td> This long fabric stole drapes over the shoulders and down to the feet of the wearer. It is normally worn over an alb or other vestment. It is made of a fine silken fabric and has upon it sewn various divine symbols, vertically down each side of the stole. When worn, the wearer may touch the various symbols, even very lightly, to recreate one of the features of the cantrip Thaumaturgy, providing a veritable special effects board of public speaking tricks. This device works for anyone wearing it, not just clerics. Three of its features may be active at once. One wonders why a cleric would have needed such a thing to be created. Hmm.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Scythe of a Death God</td>
<td>Scythe</td>
<td> This is the Scythe that lies in the Necropolis. It is lies in wait to be wielded by the champion. This scythe has a blade of the purest obsidian and a handle made of dark iron wood. It is a +3 weapon that deals and extra d6 necrotic damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mark of the Acursed</td>
<td>Amulet</td>
<td> This amulet is carried by those exiled into the Necropolis as a means of execution. This mark brands a dishonorable death, and will curse any who pick it up. Any who remove one of these amulets that are made of pure silver, has disadvantage on checks and saving throws related to a skill of the DM's Chosing until the amulet is returned to the Necropolis. (This is good for a plot hook whether your players remove it or an NPC, either way the players can have a reason to find and return the amulet)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chirpy</td>
<td>Mechanical Construct</td>
<td> A mechanical bird inside a small golden cage. It's animated, and can talk to whoever holds it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divining Dice</td>
<td>Dice used for fortune telling</td>
<td> Three dice with various markings carved of bone, one of dragon, one of beholder, and one of unicorn. Each die is used to augur a different aspect of a person's life. Dragon for wealth, beholder for power, unicorn for health. (up to the DM if the bones are what people say they are :) )</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Helm of Vomitose</td>
<td>A dented great helm</td>
<td> This helmet was cursed by a trio of warlocks, constantly harassed by an overbearing Lord to create enchanted items. They escaped his small fiefdom while he lay on the floor of their workshop, retching into the helmet. One must make a fortitude save when donning the helm. On failure, they vomit uncontrollably until removal. There is no curse that keeps the helmet on.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Trial of Faith</td>
<td>Instrument of Self Flagellation</td>
<td> This is a beautifully ornate whip with multiple lashings, each tipped with a hooked barb, and designed for self-mortification. The devout of some religious orders will use these whips to lash themselves as penance to atone for their sins. Whipping your own bare back with this instrument will cause 1d10 slashing damage, and repeating the process until you have expended half of your HP will allow you to feel a powerful connection between yourself and your divinity.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pant's of Many Pockets</td>
<td>Pants</td>
<td> A pair of pants with twenty magic pockets. An item placed into a pocket will take up the expected amount of space in the pocket, but from the outside will appear flat as if empty. Great for shop-lifting, or secreting away large-ish items.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Locking Key</td>
<td>Key</td>
<td> This is a small brass key that can lock, but not unlock, a surprising number of doors and chests and things.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bottle of Deceiving</td>
<td>Bottle</td>
<td> This bottle is designed such that it can hold two liquids. When looking at, smelling, or licking the rim of it you will believe it to hold one of those liquids, but tipping it up to drink will release the other.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Coin of Privacy</td>
<td>Magical Coin</td>
<td> While the coin is facing heads-up upon a surface such as a table, it causes the 'Silent Table' effect as per the spell. It has no effect while not set upon a surface, such as in a pocket, or while the coin is facing tails-up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ancient Worry Stone</td>
<td>Trinket</td>
<td> This palm-sized stone is flat and ellipsoidal, made from roughly hewn marble. In the center is a slight indentation, polished mirror smooth from countless thumbs rubbing circles over the aeons. Many claim that catching their own reflection in this divot brings a sense of serenity and peace of mind.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Holy Cast</td>
<td>Tool</td>
<td> This item appears to be just a normal block of bronze at first glance. Upon closer inspection however, a seam down the center becomes apparent. With a modicum of force it will split into two halves, revealing the inverse reliefs of each side of a holy symbol.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>What sorts of reading material do we find?</td>
<td>The rusty hinges that bind the book creak in protest as you open the cover. The yellowing paper is ancient and frail in your hands. The ink has faded to brown, but the words are still legible...</td>
<td> I use books and scrolls to give pieces of lore about the world to my players. They are also a great way to throw in a healthy dose of jokes and humor without making cartoonish NPCs. Scrolls don't necessarily have to contain a stored spell, they are just single-page documents (of variable length) written on rolled parchment. So, let's write some books and scrolls! The loot doesn't necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase to read now or later. These should be mostly mechanics free. If you are experiencing writer's block, roll on these books tables to generate a topic. I'll post a few examples.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Argentine Manual Of Arms For Noble Gentlemen</td>
<td>A Fencing Manual</td>
<td> A handsome volume, bound in decorated leather, with an inlaid picture of two men in court dress duelling with thin rapiers. The book details a complete fencing style specifically for court duels. It is lavishly decorated with beautiful illustrations of the positions and techniques of the Argentine style. It is not particularly suited to warfare or dungeon delving, but will allow you to avenge insults to a lady's honour while retaining your courtly poise.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The God Text</td>
<td>their</td>
<td> On the side of a mountain is a large sheer flat section, atop a treacherous scree slope. Whether the side of the mountain fell long ago and was carved later or, as legends suggest, the rock fell revealing the already existing words underneath, is unknown. The letters are five feet hight, carved the length of a tall man's arm into the rock, and are astoundingly smooth. The nesting birds that use every crook and crevice in the rock for miles around won't go anywhere near the words. The language is unknown. The letters are regular and square, grouped into words that are only ever four, eight, or sixteen letters long. The number of letters is disputed; some scholars classify subtle differences between carvings as being entirely different letters, others simply as variations. The most common counts are eighteen and thirty-two. Half of the bottom sixteen lines of text are taken up with a single, gigantic, four-letter word, carved twice as deep into the rock as the other letters. There are scrolls of the God Text found all over. They are often kept in ornately decorated scroll-cases made of precious metals. The scrolls themselves can be written on thin gold or silver foils. The letters might be embossed, or actually punched out. The accuracy of the transcription seems to change the effect it has on readers. Reading a copy of the God Text can lead people to drop everything in their lives and head towards the site of the original. Wizards studying the God Text have created new spells of astounding power and versatility. Adventurers have decoded the Text as a treasure map several times, leading to vastly far-flung places. Strangely, each time a powerful artefact of some kind has been found. One wizard claimed he was going to use the God Text as the basis for a Golem, but nothing has been heard from him, or his city, since then.</td>

There are a number of recipes for travel food, from way bread and travel rations to making a good meal from the land.</td>

<td>The Pillow Book of Date Momoko</td>
<td>A beautifully illustrated scroll that you wouldn't take home to your mother</td>
<td> I can't actually tell you much about this. Look, it's beautifully created, written on exquisitely prepared paper and the illustrations are exquisite. But let's just say that people have been known to spontaneously combust while reading it. The Hight Priest of Eros said it was "a bit much". The High Priestess ran off with her copy and hasn't been seen since. However, if there are questions about bedroom ... matters that you wish addressed, well, somewhere in this scroll I'm sure it will be. In detail. With diagrams. And, some say, maths. There's supposed to be a story running throughout, of a young bride-to-be asking her female relatives for advice on her upcoming wedding night. I wouldn't know. I've only ever handled it while wearing oven gloves and a blindfold.</td>

However, verse #77 suggests a gentle rustle through her leaves will set her desire ablaze. It's all more complicated than peasant girls, so be careful when trying to make a move on your prickly lady friend.

Each of these focuses on a first-hand account of the journey from life to death told to Calymus by a ghost, a resurrected individual or a soul called forth from the other realms. Critics suggest Calymus sensationalizes the tales a bit to make death sound more frightening than it is, to which he challenges them to explore death on their own and then come back to talk about it.</td>

The words start rhyme as the reader marks the time, and all those who are near can't resist the beat they hear. They start to bounce and dance as if they're in a trance. It only lasts a minute til the reader reaches the end. Then the scroll disappears, and all is as before.</td>

Despite these promises, the pamphlet teaches absolutely nothing that's magical in nature; rather, the final six pages are merely a hastily written list of general (and mundane) housekeeping tips, such as "Sweep your entranceway daily, to keep dirt from getting tracked about the house." Several of the tips are duplicates, as well; the total number of unique tips is actually closer to eighty.</td>

<td>The Books of Fine...</td>
<td>Sarcastic Non-Magical Books</td>
<td> It all started with an Elven wit, who on a lark one day, took a book full of blank pages, and painted on the cover "The Book of Fine Dwarven Poetry", and displayed in on his mantle at home. A local bookseller was in the home one day and noticed the book, and thought that would be a fine way to sell some blank books to folks. A lot of elves loved the joke, and bought numerous copies to give to friends and family. Sure enough though, Dwarves visiting the city were not as happy with the book, and some decided to return the favor, and so they created their own blank paged book, called the "Book of Fine Elven Craftsmanship." The Elves got quite insulted, and came out with a new blank paged book called the "Book of Fine and Attractive Dwarven Women." Needless to say, other titles ensued in this war of blank paged books, with titles like "Book of Fine and Non-Effeminate Elven Men", "Book of Fine and Bathed Dwarven Men", "Book of Fine and Non-Sheep Buggering Elves", etc. After a few months, the war mercifully ground to an end, as both sides moved on to weightier issues. But, many of those blank paged tomes are still out there.</td>

<td> The first twenty pages or so of this thin folio feature a selection of drawings, essays, and descriptions on and of the large saltwater tortoises that were once proliferant around the subtropical islands of the south. The following pages, however, seem to be written by a different hand, and while at first they follow the same structure, cryptic notes in the margins begin to overtake the text and illustrations, until they make up the entirety of the pages near the end of the book. The meaning of the notes - which largely consist of long strings of seemingly nonsense words - has been rigorously debated within the scholarly community, but at least four disparate religions and cults have been founded based on various interpretations of the text. Notably, all agree that the last page - which is naught but a tangle of scribbled, barely legible mass of ink - depicts the same thing; the face of a long dead God.</td>

The description of a ring meant to imbue the element of fire to the wearer seems to stand out as the page has been dog-eared and seems worn. Another remarkable find is near the end of the book. It's a plain bone wand that is described as having "petty and amateurish effects of prestidigitation and minor illusions," but off to the side, written in what seems to be a hastily scrawled ink, is the phrase "death conquers all."</td>

For instance, should the reader happen to recall an embarrassing memory, that would instantly appear. Oh dear, any horrible memory? Including the time mother caught me alone in the stables?

Reading that poem will act as a Monster Summoning spell, summoning that creature to the reader, and placing it under his/her control. The creature sticks around for the standard duration of a monster summoning spell, and if it's "killed" during battle, it will return to the book, but that creature will be unable to be summoned for a week afterwards.</td>

Normally, the face's eyes and mouth are closed, but when Bubistai commanded it, the eyes would open and the mouth would start reciting something. But, it can only recite things written within it's pages, so Bubistai planned to write many important and significant things within it. And indeed, he wrote magic thesises, spell research notes, and historical facts about his life within it's covers. But, unfortunately he died within a couple years of creating the book, and it fell into the hands of his apprentice, who quickly started filling the book with all sorts of nonsense, such as limericks, erotic poems, and the occasional shopping list. So, while it's called the Book of All Knowledge, buyer beware!</td>

<td>The Book of Night</td>
<td>Artifact Grimoire</td>
<td> Describing the Book of Night is difficult, in no small part because looking directly at the artifact is nearly impossible. Casual glances slide straight over the Book; it is somewhat possible to get an understanding of what it looks like merely through peripheral vision, but only a concerted effort of extreme willpower can overcome this particular attribute. Once the witness' will has been asserted, however, the Book's appearance truly manifests itself. The cover is unmarked and black, neither matte nor glossy; simply black. The surface is, furthermore, adorned with silver points of varying size. Should one attempt to move the Book, they will notice that these silver markings move--or, rather, remain fixed relative to the position of the Book. When they reach the edge of the cover, they vanish, and are replaced by others that appear on the opposite edge. A particularly astute observer will note that, when held aloft and compared to the night sky, the markings match the positions of visible stars.</td>

The bark is from no tree that yet lives; druidic lore and wizardly knowledge alike fail when confronted by it. The one time a Dryad was consulted, she spent the remainder of the day with bowed head, murmuring something not unlike a prayer. The writing itself is shockingly refined and crisp, despite being so old. The lettering is simultaneously foreign and familiar, with elements of most known scripts found in it somewhere. So far, only select words and phrases have been translated, mostly due to their similarity to one or more extant languages, and the translations have been rudimentary at best. The actual vocalization of this language is completely unknown.</td>

<td>Mincing Vellum</td>
<td>A Scroll of Intimate Scrying</td>

When placed on another person's body, one who is skilled in magic can press their face into and through the surface of the peering directly into the persons soul much as one might peer into a body of water. In fact the caster cannot breath while using this scroll, so it is limited by how long the user can hold his or her breath, or by how long the person is willing to tolerate such an intrusion. When peering into another, you may see many thing: bitterness manifesting itself as an adder's bite, the true disposition of the soul that may even be a mystery to the person whom you are looking into, spirits that may be taking refuge within the person, or are perhaps there for more malign purposes. The scroll has had many names over the years, such as Ryon's Mirror, and Gorfellow's Embrace. Those who use it should be forewarned that looking directly into a person's soul in this manner could have dire effects on a person's sanity, and it has been noted that Arghul, a promising young mage drowned when he used it and found that he was looking into a truly beatific soul and lost all notion of time and perspective and even his need for air.

Account however vary on the very last details of his life and how he in fact met his end. The book itself rarely agrees, telling a new story to every reader with the seeming intent to cause the greatest feelings sadness and pity that they may extract from the reader. Only the most cold-hearted readers of the tome have read it without it eliciting a tear, while others are haunted by the sadness for the rest of their days by the tale. It is unknown how a sorcerer of such middling talent could have wrought such a device, and it is also unknown how many, or if in fact any of the tales told within it are true. It is also impossible to to tell with any reasonable degree of certainty how Garum met his end. It is known, however, that this was the last and most notable of his bequeathed creations.</td>

And yet, over the years various sailors have added their own touches - a bundle of pigeon feathers tied with sinew to a thumbscrew, a rough etching of a stylized Kraken, an extra mirror. Its last owner (a burly gnomish privateer, the eponymous Stirgemeat) claimed to have enchanted it with the power to sight in on the Maiden's star even during the brightest day or stormiest night.</td>

<td>Mr. Mizzen's Mate's Candle</td>
<td>Minor Magical Item</td>
<td> Sold as part of the otherwise wildly successful 'Mr. Mizzen!' line of sailor's tools, the Mate's Candle was designed to serve as a replacement timepiece and light source for sailors that served the night's watch. If lit at dusk, the thin candles would burn until the next dawn, changing colors at the top of every hour as they did so. Unfortunately, the engineers at Mr. Mizzen didn't take the typical sailor's superstitious nature into account, and the candles failed to sell well, especially after stories of 'demon ships' bathed in red, orange and green lights began to circulate. A second batch of Mate's Candle was sold, marketed with 'sailor friendly' shades of white, yellow and gold, but the damage had been done. Still, many of the candles have been repurposed by cults looking for mood lighting, watchmen in coastal cities, and thrifty students.</td>

<td>Drowned Shot</td>
<td>Ammunition</td>
<td> The Slipscrew Rigs off the southern coast have been rumored to be the haunt of (in no particular order) Mergnomes, Mechoctopi, Mutamphibians, and/or Metanthopods, depending on what port you're hailing from, and how gullible you look. Regardless, most agree that the rigs' deep shale oil - shipped all along the coast in tight, cotton-wrapped bamboo casks to whoever can afford it - is some of the best on the market. Less well known is a byproduct of the drilling, flammable, dense stone known by mariners as Drowned Chull. When dried, it can be chipped, carved and shaped into pellets suitable for small cannon or flintlock longarms. While less durable than iron or lead shot, drowned shot has the advantage of being innately flammable, and has been used (with mixed effectiveness) to set sails, unwashed hair and powder stores alight.</td>

<td>Mr. Mizzen's Meticulous Mainsail</td>
<td>Minor Magical Item</td>
<td> Cut and sewn from blessed canvas, this sail repels water, dust, grime and dirt for up to (a guaranteed!) two years before the blessing fades, and the cloth becomes mundane (if perfectly serviceable). Often sold as part of a package, each sail is shipped in one of five set sizes, but can be custom altered for a nominal fee.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Orkish Cutlass</td>
<td>Mundane weapon</td>
<td> A thin, jagged sword favored by the orc reavers who terrorize the fishermen and traders of the northern coasts. Most orkish cutlasses don't last long, as the jagged edges and constant exposure to sea-spray cause the steel to rust. As such, many orc reavers carry two or three on raids.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lucky Coin of Captain Cray</td>
<td>Possibly wondrous item</td>
<td> The legendary pirate Captain Cray was known for flipping a large gold coin to decide the fate of his captives. One side of the coin is shiny and reflective and the other dark and tarnished and black. If the shiny side came up, you got a piece of steel across your throat. If the dark side came up, you got some stones tied to your feet and were given to the sea. Rumors tell that the coin aided Captain Cray with his uncanny nose for finding fantastic treasure hoards, but no one is certain how that worked...</td>

<td> This small box is the size of two fists, and covered with numerous tiny drawers. Only two of the drawers will open, but by manipulating those two drawers and sliding other cleverly hidden sections of wood, eventually you may figure out how to open all the drawers. But it may take some time. Each drawer holds it's own tiny treasure (rings, tiny notes, a gem, a living butterfly etc). The box cannot be damaged or forced in any way.</td>

Though not made from real pearls, they reflect light in a vaguely enchanting manner. On the seas, sailors would trade marbles and similar trinkets as a form of currency, getting favors from one another or what not. Some captains even paid their mean in marbles and bead, though this often did not go over well once on land.</td>

The outside is rimed with salt crystals which regenerate when brushed away, but these don't seem to affect the chalice itself. When water is placed into the cup, it is instantly rendered salty and undrinkable. In addition, the cup produces deafening sounds of surf until it is emptied. Non-water beverages, such as alcohol, milk, juice, etc. are unaffected.</td>

Under these circumstances, the ends of the strings smolder and catch fire, creating a hellish glow over the wearer's face.</td>

<td>Magical Figurehead</td>
<td> An old ship's figurehead, carved from white wood and splintered at the base. It depicts an aged man leaning forward and cupping an ear, as if listening intently for threats. An old smuggler's tale is that if you find and attach Ol' Carbunkle to your ship, you'll never be bothered by pesky lawsmen as you slink in or out of port. Given that Ol' Carbunkle's is currently mounted above the door to the Naval Guardsman's Barracks, take the story with a pinch of salt.</td>

<td>Gold-eater's Shell</td>
<td>Tiny Beast</td>
<td> This small, ornate shell fits in the palm of your hand. The shell itself appears to be made of silver, with what appears to be streaks of various precious minerals streaking through it. At first glance, it appears to be empty and would likely fetch some decent coin. Inside the shell however, lies a very small hermit crab with very expensive tastes. When the crab feels safe, it will set off to find it's favourite meal: gold (coins or otherwise). The shell shifts steadily from silver to gold over time as it gorges itself on more riches.</td>

<td>Seahorse statuette</td>
<td>Tiny Beast/Tiny Statue</td>
<td> This small seahorse figurine appears to be made of solid gold, with brilliant sapphires for eyes. When removed from the water for extended periods of time, the gold begins to soften and liquefy as though melting off of the statuette. If the statuette is not returned to the water in time, the polished golden skin and sapphire eyes fade, leaving a normal (and live) seahorse in its place. Once returned to the water, the seahorse slowly crystallizes back to its statuette state but will rapidly try to escape its captors before it does so.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dwarven Mastbreaker</td>
<td>Magical item of sabotage</td>
<td> Resembling a collar for giant animals, this particularly mischievous item is comprised of two large halves, hinged in the middle. It is masterfully sculpted out of gold and decorated with several Dwarven runes. When clasped around the mast of a ship, the runes glow orange and a soft humming sound can barely be heard as the device slowly spins around the outside of the mast. After about an hour, the device will have cut through any mast, and the mast will fall, possibly on the ship itself. Perfect for sabotage!</td>

<td>Magical Hat</td>
<td> This Tricorn hat fits snugly onto it's wearer's head, and will stay on, despite wind, rain, strong tugging, or any other physical method attempted to remove it. The wearer can remove it anytime they want though. On command, the hat will sprout three horns, one on each corner, which the wearer can use for a goring attack, or due to the sharpness of the points, as a slashing attack. Standard non-proficiency penalties apply, but most users hide it's special power to use in a surprise attack sort of situation, thus mitigating the penalties with a surprise bonus.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>TriBlade Hat</td>
<td>Clockwork hat</td>
<td> This Tricorn hat, made out of gears, springs and cogs, is heavier than your normal Tricorn hat, and has a thick leather strap that fastens around the wearers chin. The hat consists of two parts, a skullcap rests snuggly on the wearers head, while the bulk of the hat is attached to the skullcap. Upon command, a blade folds out from each of the corners of the hat, and the hat starts rotating around the skullcap, lifting the wearer aloft, so the user can slowly fly, changing direction/altitude by head movements. The hat uses oil as fuel, and can fly for about 10 minutes before running out of fuel.</td>

But once installed in a ship's helm, one need only envision a place and the globe rotates to highlight the shortest naval route route there, or as close to the location as the ship can sail. It also displays accurate oversea distances along the route, particularly useful for crews in poorly charted waters or with limited rations and supplies.</td>

<td>So, what are we drinking tonight?</td>
<td>THIRSTY</td>
<td> Fermented drinks are so much more than something to sip or to chug to unwind at the end of a busy adventuring day. Each tells a story of the brewer, vintner, or distiller who carefully crafted it. In a fantasy setting, some of these may come with magical effects, akin to a potion, but others are simply magical to experience. So, let's write some ales, wines, and other spirits! The loot doesn't necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to purchase for a long journey or pay a little extra to enjoy on premises at a pub. These should be mostly mechanics free.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gnollblood Mead</td>
<td>Nonmagical mead</td>
<td> While the inventor of this recipe is said to have been human, anyone is welcome to make it- if they can survive the trial of getting the ingredients. True to its name, after the mead is sweetened with honey and boiled with a blend of spices, the maker stirs in just enough gnoll's blood to give the brew a salty, rusty undertone. This conveys no magical benefit, but it's still quite popular among the wealthy citizens of the local cities (the types who have never even seen a gnoll, let alone slayed one). Brewers within the city limits will pay handsomely for fresh gnoll carcasses to keep their blood supply in check.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bragget</td>
<td>Goblin "wine"</td>
<td> Made from fermented, often rotting cave mushrooms, bragget is the favored drink of any goblin who wants to quickly lose their inhibition. There's no real recipe to follow- simply throw a handful of fresh mushrooms into a vat of water, forget it for several months, rediscover the vat after a crew of adventurers break into your cave system, and drink it. Effects range from a gleeful, giddy state of inebriation to death from dysentery (or both).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cobbler's Cream</td>
<td>Rotgut, Swill</td>
<td> Gnomes who dwell along the forest's edge often send their young to forage for meals in dense, semi-cultivated plots filled with berries, brambles, succulent flowers and herbs of all varieties. Having not yet developed a callous thick enough to endure the thorns, prickles and stings, many young Gnomes often wear carved wooden shoes and heavy leather gaiters to protect themselves. When a young Gnome reaches maturity, however, they are expected to retire their shoes back to the cobbler, where the toes are stuffed full of harvested berries, leaves, mushrooms and whatever else comes to hand. The shoes are then hung from the rafters over a large vat, where steam, time, and the natural yeasts in the porous wood allow droplets of alcoholic liquid to seep through the shoe, and fall into the roiling mixture below. Mixed with rainwater, and served in (usually) cleaned wooden shoes, the resulting beverage is incredibly potent, with a flavor profile that ranges from incredibly profane to lavender, with notes of sweet sap. Gnomes who consume it often do so in celebratory contexts, and in small quantities. Most others experience temporary blindness and an intense hatred for Gnomes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blood Clot</td>
<td>Dwarven Sludge</td>
<td> This bizarre concoction is a favorite among Dwarves looking to make a dare. Thick and red, it contains a congealed glob of fermented goat milk about the size of a golf ball. An acquired taste, it is reminiscent of fortified wine with a strong hint of copper.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Demon's Piss</td>
<td>Dragonfruit Wine</td>
<td> Demon's Piss is created using fermented dragonfruit and a secret recipe of herbs and spices that varies from town to town. The general flavor is of dragonfruit but often has a backend of licorice, nutmeg, and/or lemon. It is loved more for its flavor than strength, it is only 12 proof.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Axegrinder Ale</td>
<td>Dwarvish ale</td>
<td> In the right light, this ale takes on a blood red hue. It gives off a strong scent like a floral meadow covered in dew and tastes slightly sour on the way down with a sweaty finish. Dwarves who consume it often become mildly belligerent and take offense the smallest slights. Most others who consume it experience a noticeable uptick in their spirits (except trolls, they just get angry).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bitterbeard Ale</td>
<td>Dwarvish ale</td>
<td> This translucent gold ale is topped with a clean white foam and tastes a little pungent and bitter with hints of citrus. Dwarves who consume it tend to brood over hated foes, especially "the one that got away." Non-dwarves who consume it typically experience a pleasant evening followed by a poor night's sleep.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rockbiter Porter</td>
<td>Dwarvish stout</td>
<td> This dark muddy brown brew is nearly opaque. Its nose is reminiscent of a rich autumn feast and its flavor has notes of creamy roasted toffee and just a hint of mustiness. Dwarves who consume it are often overcome with great confidence in their own physical strength. Non-dwarves who consume it have trouble finishing even a single pint because it makes the stomach feel so full.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nightsky Strongwine</td>
<td>Elvish wine</td>
<td> This deep purple wine is sweet and smooth, and often served after dinner at elvish feasts. In its preparation, the grapes are crushed under an open sky on a clear moonless night to achieve the greatest effects. Elves who consume it are often filled with nostalgia, but other drinkers become very sleepy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Meadowlark</td>
<td>Human wheat beer</td>
<td> In a world full of 750,000-proof Elven cordials and Dwarven stouts so thick you'd think they were bottled mud, sometimes you just need a good beer. Mild, refreshing, and flavorful, Meadowlark is a beer by humans, for humans, which means that just about every halfling from here to the Drypeak Mountains is drinking it. The noble think it crude, the elves think it unimaginative, the dwarves find it cowardly, but the farmers who drop themselves down at a tavern table at the end of the day wouldn't have anything else.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frostbomb</td>
<td>Pale ale</td>
<td> The life's work of a dragonborn brewmaster. Frostbomb is somewhat disconcerting, for a couple of reasons. One, it's blue. For those who prefer not to consume things that are the color of their cousin Clyde that one time he tried to swallow a carrot whole, that might be a bit of a turn-off. Two, it is absolutely frigid. The steel bottles that it's shipped in are often coated in a thick rime of frost that must be hacked off before serving, and the cold magic in the brew must be allowed to sit for at least four minutes before it's warm enough to not be painful going down. All that being said, there isn't a traveler alive who doesn't hope to stumble upon a bottle under the counter in a desert bar.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Steve's Mead</td>
<td>Mead</td>
<td> This bottle of mead might have had a label, once, but it appears to have been torn off. In its place, painted directly on the bottle, are the words "STEVE'S MEAD" in blocky, crude letters. Clearly, Steve is not around to claim his mead, but in his absence the cork appears to be permanently and irrevocably stuck in the mouth of the bottle.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Self-important Prick</td>
<td>Brown ale</td>
<td> The ale inside this bottle isn't terribly unusual, aside from being harsh and bitter. The true draw is the printing on the bottle, which reads "Self-Important Prick" in white letters. Under the lettering is a rendition of a face--a rendition that changes to reflect whoever the drinker dislikes the most at that particular time. There are allegations that drinking the ale results in heightened animosity toward the depicted person, but it might just be a result of reminding them that that person exists in the first place.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fermented Femininity</td>
<td>Semi-magical Wine</td>
<td> A bright pink, cool wine that tastes like a perfect, ripe, sugared grape. That is, it tastes like that if you're a woman. For men who drink though, it not only tastes like roadkill, but goes down like tar. Rumor is that the grapes used for the wine come from a vineyard that was cursed by a spiteful nature spirit (or goddess, depending on how dramatic the storyteller is) when she found out that the man she pined for was gay. She cursed the man and his lands so that anything he grew would only be able to please women.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sugar Rush Rum</td>
<td>Magical Rum</td>
<td> The Halflings are often unfairly compared to children, but when it comes to their choice of drink, the comparison isn't totally wrong. Sugar Rush Rum is one of the better examples of that. It's a golden drink that somehow produces sky blue foam and tastes more like candy than alcohol. In fact, it's common practice in some areas to put sprinkles in the brew. There are reasons to drink the stuff other than a sweet tooth though. The rum isn't called Sugar Rush for nothing, as it triggers a mystic rush of energy after drinking it, making the imbiber faster and increasing their reflexes, but making it much harder to focus on anything for more than a few seconds. More than one foolish leader has tried to increase his army's fighting ability with the drink, and instead ended up with half of his troops simply wandering away before a fight could even begin.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>King's Seal</td>
<td>Nonmagical Drink</td>
<td> Named so due to the molten wax used to make it, mixed with wine, cloves and other flavour-enhancing components, this is favoured as a cool, refreshing beverage for lesser Fire Elementals when it gets so hot even they feel the need to cool off a bit, and very popular with fire Genasi and tieflings, who like to show off how much heat they can handle, the constipation and horrible hangovers be damned.</td>

<td>Really, Really, Really Black Rum</td>
<td>Barely-Magical alchohol</td>

<td>The Drunken Tosser</td>
<td>Dwarven engineering</td>
<td> When drunk, all attacks do an additional 1d6 damage in drunken fervor until hit. On hit, forced use of reaction to projectile vomit at creature who hit you. Vomit does additional 1d10 acid damage. Auto hit if in melee range, range is twenty feet, +2 to hit vs. AC. A miss leaves the five foot square covered in acid that effects any who enter. Lasts d20/2 rounds.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hand Glob</td>
<td>Magical spirit</td>
<td> This spirit was inspired by a mage renowned for his Hand spells, and is magically fermented to create a special magical effect. While it looks and acts like normal liquor, if you pour some out onto your hand, it won't actually touch your hand but will become a glob that floats above your hand. You can toss it back and forth between your hands, and even hand or toss the glob to another person, which as you can imagine leads to all sorts of bar games and hijinks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fire Eye Brew</td>
<td>Spirit</td>
<td> Brewed by gnomes using various fungi, this spirit gives the imbiber eyes that glow orange. A couple minutes after drinking a shot, the imbibers eyes start glowing, and the imbiber gains Darkvision for 10 minutes or so. But, while it helps those normally without darkvision navigate the Underdark, the glow stands out as a bright beacon to it's denizens.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Golden Touch</td>
<td>Nonmagical Cider</td>
<td> An almost jet black liquid, this alcohol looks and smells terrible. Made from a strange variety of black berries which grow at the bottom of swamps and bogs, many compare the smell and look to those of something long dead. When imbibed by an undead it tastes very sweet and seems to build till a refreshing aftertaste after a few moments. This has made it a heavy favorite for vampires and the like. Living creatures who taste it describe it as oddly sour but still delicious. Sailors often create this wonderful cider by taking leftover bits of fruit, such as cores and peels, and shoving them into the husk of a peltur fruit to be left out in the sun for several days. Once all the bits and pieces are removed, all that is left is a shiny yellow liquid that has a variety of fruity tastes. One benefit of this drink, other than the inebriation, is that it helps sailor’s combat scurvy. Some starving sailors have compared the taste to the kiss of a lover and common folklore claims that it can help revitalize a man on an empty stomach.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mudwiser</td>
<td>Orcish ale</td>
<td> Brewed in large batches with low quality control standards, other races denounce this popular brand as swill. A perennial favorite in the worst dives and at the gladiator pits with a taste reminiscent of the mudbogs where it was first created. Orcs love it. Drinking boisterously in large quantities, they attribute all their best decisions to its influence.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thadwick Snidwak’s Golden Libation</td>
<td>Magical mead</td>
<td> This sweet, slightly metallic drink goes down smooth and tastes like a million gold. The proprietary recipe is a closely guarded secret of the mad wizard. Rumor has it the drink contains actual gold and will bring great riches to any who partake. But Snidwak was a vindictive bugger who specially brewed this drink to wreak his revenge on the party guests who snubbed him. Most of them still wander his Tower of Sullitude, the now-cool gold shining brightly in the holes burned through their flesh by the molten metal.</td>

<td>Tekillya</td>
<td>Hard liquor</td>
<td> Popular among the lizardfolk, this heavy-hitting spirit probably won’t actually kill you. Brewed from fermented cactus and rumbleweed, the secret ingredient is the venom of the tiny Krillworm.

<td>Smoking Dreamkiller</td>
<td>Mixed drink</td>
<td> Not for the fainthearted. This drink packs a wallop. The various ingredients remain separated in layers. The first is harsh and bitter, enticing the drinker to stare into a half-empty mug pondering what might have been. When the second layer is exposed to the atmosphere, it reacts with the air to create the signature smoky mist in the cup, which drinkers swear shows them visions of a heroic destiny about to unfold. The third layer fortifies a man’s spirit to “stand up and do something with your life!” The fourth and final layer goes down in a manly rush, usually accompanied by a belch and slamming the empty mug, still smoking, onto the bar and leaping into action to grab life by the throat. The sudden movement triggers the layers to mix in the drinker’s stomach, almost universally resulting in immediate unconsciousness and a deep, dreamless sleep. The drinker awakes 2d10 hours later, well-rested, forgetting the troubles of the previous night and ready to tackle the humdrum life of feudal servitude.</td>

<td>Ogre Punch</td>
<td>Thick, sludgy, ale?</td>
<td> No one is really sure what this stuff is, but it's brewed by Ogres, and can sometimes be found on them while looting their corpses. It's has a consistency of syrup, and smells like an Ass's back end, but is one of the strongest brews you will ever find. It's strong enough for Ogre's, which means it's way too strong for anyone else. Just a sip of this stuff is enough to knock even a dwarf on her read end. Although supposedly it is favored by Dragons, due to it's potency.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tears of Regret</td>
<td>Cursed Magical Ale</td>
<td> The ale is highly sought by unscrupulous bar owners, who then secretly replace a competitors ale with it. It makes the imbiber sad and regretful, as they wallow in the memories of lost loves, family, friends, and opportunities. Even more so than they usually regret those things. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous bar owner makes sure his joint is jumping and happy, with everyone having a good time, and making sure that the patrons at the now sad, depressing bar hear where the fun is happening.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blauzeeg Brew</td>
<td>Human ale</td>
<td> The in-house beer of the Blauzeeg Inn and Tavern, this brew can most readily be obtained on draft in the village of Gelbfar, where it is made. Occasional casks and kegs are sold to barge crews or caravans as an export good of sorts, though the brewing operation is small as such things go. Your basic inoffensive brown ale with a slightly nutty finish.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vackulderbeck</td>
<td>cheap gin</td>
<td> With a not unearned reputation for turpentine-like flavor, Vackulderbeck is popular largely with alcoholics too far gone to have functioning tastebuds.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Deep Grog</td>
<td>Blackest Tot</td>
<td> The darkest of naval rum taken from sunken sips mixed with saltwater taken from the pelagic depths of the Elemental Plane of Water. Black and cold, with a syrupy mouth feel. Tastes of brine and molasses with a distinct bitterness. Reserved for first time travelers to The City of Glass, and served as a shot with a still beating fish heart. Also disparagingly known as Aboleth's Piss.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hyperborean Cider</td>
<td>Bottled Sunshine</td>
<td> Fermented with juice made from apples collected from the Celestial Plane. Gloriously, radiantly golden, no head, ever, and never sours. Sweet and warm, with hints of clove, cinnamon, and sunrises. You can still get a hangover, don’t believe that myth, and there are few things in the multiverse worse than being hungover on the Celestial Plane. Everyone is singing and everything IS SO VERY BRIGHT.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Old Polder Genever Gin</td>
<td>Spirit's Spirits</td>
<td> The recipe for this liquor was pulled from the ruins of the necropolis of Polder. Clear or just faintly brown, sweet with juniper and malt. More like a whiskey than a gin. Purportedly aged in oak barrels with a single golden coin taken from the dead city, luck be damned. Said to be able to distract hungry dead by offering shots. Popular gift on Spirt's Eve.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Airak</td>
<td>Djinn and Juice</td>
<td> Distilled on the Elemental Plane of Air by the Djinn in a process that uses no machinery, but by captive air elementals controlling the temperatures and pressures while the liquid free floats in the air. Clear when poured but will louche when exposed to normal air pressure. Tastes of licorice, anise, and a warm breeze with a slight bitter aftertaste. Makes you lightheaded, maybe literally. Best mixed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Neverwinter Nightmare</td>
<td>Non-magical spirit</td>
<td> This cheap alcohol is made from fermented chestnuts, which grow plenty in and around Neverwinter. A particularly strong variety is made by a gang of Neverwinter urchins, who hawk their ware on the streets. Some of the more, ah, entrepreneurial urchins will pick your pocket while you try and haggle for a lower price. It's called a nightmare because there are multiple species of chestnuts, and one of those is not suitable for fermentation. If used anyhow, the resulting spirit will give the drinker a troubled and fitful sleep with vivid nightmares.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Elven Feather Wine</td>
<td>Light Elven wine</td>
<td> This light elven wine is said to be made by straining liquid from gooseberries through a special filter made of eagle's feathers and then fermented in casks hanging from tree branches. Popular with elves because of it's light airiness, it will actually give any who drink a slight increase to their dexterity and movement speed for approximately an hour.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jester Juice</td>
<td>Mixed Drink</td>
<td> Sold Exclusively at The Jester's Johnson tavern, this golden beverage smells indistinguishable from a Meadowlark human draft beer. Unfortunately, it tastes like straight unicorn piss. Often purchased as a practical joke on stag nights and 18th birthdays. Has an interesting side-effect that drastically increases labido.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Liar's Brew</td>
<td>Mixed Drink</td>
<td> An exclusive brew at The Liar's Den tavern, This mysterious, lavender drink is advertised to contain numerous special ingredients, though it tastes suspiciously like Gin and Juice. The effects hit hard and fast. They call it the Liar's Brew because those under its effects tend to spill more secrets than they mean to.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gray Sludge</td>
<td>Magical Alcoholic "Drink"</td>
<td> Gray Sludge is an orcish drink that smells, looks, and tastes foul. No sane man would drink this for pleasure. Shamans make it by fermenting a mixture of miscellaneous organic material, then enchanting it. It is surprisingly filling, if you can force it down. In addition to intoxication, it increases the endurance and strength of the drinker.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kevinsbane</td>
<td>Magical strong spirit</td>
<td> This drink is mostly clear, with a slight bluish tint. It is distilled by a legendarily incompetent wizard, and ensures the drinker will have a very... interesting night. It makes one recklessly confident and greatly impairs judgement, even more than normal alcohol. However, it also gives courage, and ensures that everything you do will either succeed amazingly or fail horribly.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pissin' Goblin</td>
<td>Ale, Swill</td>
<td> A popular yet terrible ale enjoyed for the simple fact it gets you drunk. With a cloudy blonde colour and taste reminiscent of grass, pine and pepper. Those who drink large quantities are said to develop incontinence and bouts of kleptomania, though that might just be the alcohol.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Go Juice</td>
<td>Spirit</td>
<td> A spirit much like vodka brewed from potatoes and a mysterious chile pepper grown in the depths of an insane asylum . The drink is known for its use as a way to pump and excite before a battle, with many drinkers reportedly being run through with a sword and still fight till their buzz wears off. It is also known for the heat and spicy of its flavour. The drink comes in many irregular bottles and containers, but they always have "GO JUICE" written in an almost illegible scrawl.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aethernol</td>
<td>Magic Spirit</td>
<td> Refined from a combination of ectoplasm and gelatinous cube remains, this extremely potent liquor has optical properties identical to air. Since pouring a glass of it without spilling is functionally impossible, Aethernol can only be purchased by the bottle. It conveys a limited ability to see into the future, by exactly as much as the intoxication affects your reaction time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Winter's Tooth</td>
<td>Magical Shot</td>
<td> A light, minty blue shot that stings going down. Instead of a burning sensation, the drinker's throat feels frozen and icy. Great for hot days. Most individuals find their tongue and throat numb for ten to twenty minutes immediately afterward.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bawler's Brew</td>
<td>Magical Lager</td>
<td> Most of those who order this drink do so by accident. Most mishear the name and believe it will make them more tenacious in battle and savage in the ring. However, they find that the watery drink they are handed will have them filled with heartache and breaking down into tears halfway through their fight.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Baconater</td>
<td>Magical Ale</td>
<td> Order by large groups of friends or acquaintances, those drinking the Baconater have drunken arguments about who knows people who have met the famous hero "Kevinior Baconicus" and how many people they know "who know a guy" that have fought alongside him.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ko-brandy</td>
<td>Kobold Spirit</td>
<td> Mostly water. Found in every kobold encampment, this drink is "brewed" in a boiling pot filled with twigs and leaves. A few drops of potent poison from the Catstalk Viper are added and left sit for at least a year to break it down into an "alcohol-like" substance. It is rarely drunk except by the leaders of kobold camps on special holidays and political meetings. An "unripe" batch has a high chance of killing any non-kobold who imbibes it, and does not get them drunk in any way. A kobold who drinks of the Ko-Brandy is much more persuasive, and in rare cases aggressive.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ginger Ale</td>
<td>Nonmagical(?) Ale</td>
<td> Just a normal ginger beer. You've always had red hair, right?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bitterthorn Dry</td>
<td>Absinthe</td>
<td> This dark green spirit is distilled from the needles of the bitterthorn pine, which are chewed as a stimulant in the far North. Once distilled into a spirit, it has a sharp, acidic taste with notes of evergreen, and has plenty of kick for a cold winter night.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bezoar Red</td>
<td>Magical Wine</td>
<td> This fantastically expensive wine is fermented with a bezoar in every single bottle. This makes it a reliable anti-toxin as well as giving the drink a rich, earthy taste, making it popular with paranoid nobles and cautious rulers. Mechanics wise, it functions as an anti-toxin vial from the Adventuring Gear, as once imbibed, it gives Advantage on saving throws against poison for one hour. A nice treasure for your players- lots of gold if sold to a noble, or a useful resource if needed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sanninion (lit. "Diamondfire")</td>
<td>Grey Elven Liquor</td>
<td> A sharp, clear liquor distilled from hardy, fermented roots found around grey elven citadels. Finer distilleries are known to remove almost all of the burn from the liquor, allowing it to go down like water, while lesser distilleries produce a product with an acrid taste sure to make the drinker cough and sputter.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cavruniel (lit. Thornwine)</td>
<td>Grey Elven Liquor</td>
<td> While most elven cultures are renowned for their wine production, the elves of the north have neither the tools nor resources necessary to construct functioning, profitable vineyards. The closest they offer to wine is Cavruniel, a strong, transparent liquor that offers a blossoming juniper taste upon the palette, said to be quite pleasant to those who have grown accustomed to it.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grog Spawn</td>
<td>Absolutely Vile</td>
<td> A drink made by Bullywugs. Looks like mud, smells like mud, tastes like... Well, mud, with a hint of grain alcohol. But don't you dare refuse the Bullywug monarchs offer of a taste of their own personal-brewed Grog Spawn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Old Nothic Knuckle</td>
<td>Old Ale Fortified With Nothic Fingers</td>
<td> This old ale came into existence on a bit of a dare, and is usually consumed on one as well. A crew of travelling sellswords brought the body of a Nothic into a tavern after a typical day of looting a wizard's crumbling tower. One of them chopped the Nothic's hand up into several even parts and dared his friends to drink their ales after he had dropped the bloody fingers in each mug. There was enough necrotic energy left in the monster's blood to give them all a terrifying hallucinatory experience that has become legend. These days the ale is typically fortified and rarely has a simple scrap of a Nothic in it as Nothic blood is widely assumed to be too dangerous for consumption. Old Nothic Knuckle is stored and displayed in clear glass to show off the fingers inside, and is usually imbibed as shots taken on a dare. They say the only way to tell you've had a true Old Nothic Knuckle is when you start screaming at nothing. 11% ABV</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Doppelganger Dopplebock</td>
<td>Lager</td>
<td> This strong beer looks, smells and tastes like a more popular and well known lager. A jealous brewer from Waterdeep couldn't fathom his beer being outsold by a new and talented young brewer in town, so he hired a Tiefling thief to steal the recipe. Unfortunately, the thief got away with a much earlier version of this now perfected and much-loved recipe. There's something a little off when observing the dark brown and red-highlighted color of this brew, but there's a little something off of the price too. 9% ABV</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dragon's Horde</td>
<td>Alchemical Lambic</td>
<td> A lustrous, golden body beneath a luxurious white foam are enough to draw most in for this adventurous beer. What's more, through clever alchemy, the carbonation that rises from the bottom of the glass twinkles in brilliant reds, greens, and blues as the flavor shifts from berries to stone fruit to apples and back again.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hob-Nobber</td>
<td>Hobgoblin Spirit</td>
<td> Distilled within a natural basin within the cold stone of Weatherwill cave, this murky spirit is a classic among young hobgoblins. Slightly chartreuse, it tastes faintly of lemons and ice until it reaches the belly. POW! A sucker-punch right in the abdomen. Combined with the sweet aftertaste, it's a perfect blend of pain and pleasure.</td>
