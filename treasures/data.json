Crafted by Mindflayers in the depths below through unspeakable rituals, it is psychoreactive, psionically moldable, and supernaturally durable and useful for crafting if one knows how to work it.

Some minor magic has infiltrated the tome and causes a heightened state of self-awareness after ten minutes of reading. Reading the tome for an hour or more produces a sensation akin to continual sexual arousal and stimulation. These effects cease the instant the reader looks away from the tome. If the reader continues to read for longer than 8 hours, they experience random, acute narcoleptic episodes for the following 24 hours."},{"name":"Skin-bound Ledger","type":"Information","description":" A small lined notebook bound in supple, tanned leather, with a dedication in the front cover reading \"Binding from Reijek, RIP.\" Touching the ledger produces a deep sense of revulsion strong enough to prevent the weak-willed from looking at its contents.

A creature can use its action to eat an Okayberry. Eating a berry restores 0.5 hitpoints (rounded down), and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for 15 minutes. Up to 6d4 berries are found at a time, and spoil after 2 weeks. They never fully ripen or taste any better."},{"name":"Moistanite","type":"Gems","description":" Glimmering, clear gems that can be magically produced during storms of wild magic. Each is as brilliant and clear as a diamond, but they are usually larger and less over-priced, though they are- paradoxically- magically inert and useless as components in spells.

Opening the hinged lid of the box reveals a small illusory locker room containing a coach in the middle of a high-pitched, half-time pep-talk to a group of underdogs. Closer inspection reveals every entity in the box has the exact physical features of the person who opened the box. The speech will continue as long as the box is open, though the coach becomes increasingly desperate, sweaty, and incoherent after 2 hours. When the box is closed, there is a barely audible cheer of \"Team spirit!\" from the entities."},{"name":"Blade Tattoo","type":"Consumable Magic Item","description":" Tattoo and ink set allowing up to 12 tattoos to be made.

The portal is one way."},{"name":"Porcelain Plate of Anger","type":"Better than Nothing Magical Items","description":" This white dinner plate is simply adorned with a blue stripe that goes around the brim. When someone picks up the plate, they must immediately make a will save (or game equivalent) or be irrationally angry for 1d4+1 rounds. In addition, the plate is then immediately thrown against the nearest wall or ground (This effect takes up the first round of anger). The plate shatters upon impact, but magically fixes itself after 1d6 minutes. The rage effect can happen three of times per day per person. If the person picking up the plate is a barbarian that has rage rounds, these rounds can be used as free rage rounds. The number of rounds caused by the plate does not count against the number of rounds they can rage in a day."},{"name":"Folding Bridge","type":"Better than nothing magic items","description":" This item looks like an unassuming 8 ft. plank of lumber, but close examination of the ends reveals seams in the wood. The seams can be pulled apart to unfold the plank to form a solid bridge of any of the following sizes: It takes a full round to unfold the bridge from one size to the next. It can be folded back up to its portable size at the same rate. Once unfolded, the bridge can be placed across any gap and holds in place without apparent support. It can withstand up to 40,000 pounds in weight; any excess weight causes the bridge to break, permanently destroying it. The bridge can be easily be lifted at either end. Regardless of size the bridge itself always weighs the same as it does in its plank form (15 lb.) plus the weight of whatever is currently atop it. The collapsible bridge can be attuned to a particular person. Once attuned, only that person may unfold or fold the bridge, until it is attuned to someone else. Furthermore, only the person so attuned can lift the bridge once placed."},{"name":"Inflatable Skeletons Box","type":"Better than nothing magic items","description":" A palm-sized heaxagonal box carved from ebony, with a removal lid on both sides. Both lids are etched in the design of a skull, one smaller than the other. When opened, the off-white contents within begin inflating rapidly like a balloon filling with gas. If the larger skull lid is removed, after thirty seconds of inflation a human skeleton appears in a free space adjacent to the box. The skeleton is genuine and not in itself magical. If the smaller skull lid is removed, inflation takes twenty seconds and a halfling skeleton appears instead. The box can create one inflatable skeleton per day. If a skeleton is created while another exists, the first crumbles to dust. Perfect for causing distractions, framing enemies, and entertaining at children\u0027s parties."},{"name":"Laughing Idol","type":"Better than nothing magic items","description":" A six-inch high statuette carved of jade in the likeness of a hugely overweight robed man in the throws of laughter. Once per day, the statuette can be rubbed to immediately cause sapient creatures within a 60-foot radius centred on the statue, with the exception of the creature who rubbed the idol, to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, the creature is suddenly immensely amused and unable to contain their high spirits, becoming both incapacitated and restrained on their next turn following the saving throw."},{"name":"Simple Bunting","type":"Better than Nothing Magical Items","description":" A brightly-colored flag checkered with a diamond-pattern, this seemingly innocuous piece of fabric is both stylish and functional.

That\u0027s it. But it\u0027s classified as \u0027art\u0027 so I\u0027m sure somebody would be willing to pay a hefty sum for it.

The scent of the perfume lasts for one hour after application and makes you irresistible to pixies, sprites, and goblins. These creatures can smell you from up to 1,000 feet away and will attempt to touch you, unless you have shown yourself to be a threat to them. Hobgoblins and bugbears can also smell the scent from 1,000 feet away, but they will become furious when they get within 30 feet of you and realize that you are not, in fact, a tasty pixie or sprite."},{"name":"Ghoulflesh Scented Candles","type":"Better than Nothing Magic Item","description":" When you burn this candle, the smoky odor of roasting ghoulflesh fills the room, ideal for setting the mood for foul necromantic rituals, preparing volunteers for human sacrifice, and all manner of depraved acts involving corpses.

He put it out with a hot poker, preserved it by mummification, then animated it with a foul ritual. The eye twitches a bit, but otherwise it doesn\u0027t appear to do anything. However, the one-eyed necromancer, wherever he is, can see what the eye sees as if it were still in his head (provided he didn\u0027t damage it too badly with the hot poker)."},{"name":"Riv Stecke\u0027s Guide to Fey Crossings","type":"Book","description":" This book will help you find the nearest fey crossing to make your way into the Feywild.

Unfortunately the words of the ring are lost to the mists of time."},{"name":"Gideon\u0027s Last Wish","type":"Better Than Nothing Magical Item","description":" The last known relic of Archmage Gideon. This amulet hangs around the user\u0027s neck with a minor enchantment on it that makes it slightly uncomfortable to wear, unable to be dispelled.

When wielded alone it will be nothing more than ordinary. Steel is a shortsword that shines like silver polished to a mirror sheen, imbued with magical properties it will shock living flesh with sparks of electricity when brought into contact with it.

The creature is captured, almost photographically, rising on its hind legs, neck outstretched, as if to greet some friendly hand which is in turn reaching out to stroke its reptilian head. Such quality, finesse, and attention to detail is unheard of in modern casting methods, and were it not so preposterous a concept, one could be forgiven for thinking that it might be a living being, cursed by some unknown magics in the distant past."},{"name":"Perfectly Ordinary ChickenTM","type":"Pet","description":" It\u0027s a chicken."},{"name":"The Squeezy Dolphin of Endless Water","type":"Magic Item","description":" This is, to all intents and porpoises, a Decanter of Endless Water, with one small variation - it seems to be a child\u0027s toy, which produces only a small squirt of water when squeezed.

You can use one of the dice to achieve the maximum roll of that dice type when one is rolled during the game. In doing so, the corresponding dice vanishes from the block. This is intended to be something that you might even make (from cheap dice and blu-tak, perhaps?) and hand to the player who loots it. It will appear, in-game, to be a simple object, albeit one with a faintly magical aura. Once attuned to the object, the character learns that they can call on its power when in need. I called \"meta-magic item\" because it\u0027s sort of in the boundary between player and character, if that makes any sense."},{"name":"Tricksy Rope","type":"Magic Item","description":" Touching the rope will activate it, but will also drain 1d4 HP. Once activated, the rope will obey your mental commands to the best of its ability. It can rear up like a snake, and tie itself in knots.

I got carried away. This axe is always covered with tacky almost dried blood. Even when cleaned the blood always returns. The axe itself has a bad history of betrayal and vengeance which lead to it gaining powers. The axe was originally forged by an elven smith living in a human city along with other weapons. The smith was to forge \"100 pounds of good steel\" to pay off his gambling debt. The holder of said debt found many \"problems\" with the expertly crafted steel and kept the elf in servitude for months after the debt was paid. The next instance of betrayal was against the man holding the debt, though he may have deserved it the betrayer had no way of knowing that. A half elf merchant and his men bought the steel in bulk all of the elves work after the forgemaster had been freed. They paid in enchanted copper coins, The holder of the dept was hanged when he paid his taxes in fake gold coins. The Half elf and his men traveled south hoping to trade their ill gotten gains and found the road had been blocked by a tribe of gnolls. A gnome and his band offered to help but only if he got half payment now and the other half when the job was done. This did not end well for the half elf whom paid in a crate of his wares. The gnome returned and said the road was safe and his men would guard the caravan until it reached the town past the plains. He was lying of course and had given the gnolls the crate of weapons in exchange for their help slaughtering the half elf and his men. The gnolls promised the gnome the wealth in exchange for the weapons. They lied too. The gnolls left the scene with all of it including the weapon that would later be called the Axe of the Betrayed. The gnolls lived in a strict matriarchy and the gnoll whom acquired the axe was the brother of the reigning matriarch. Given only select females were allowed to breed any offspring from any non sanctioned unions would be eliminated. A warrior female and the brother to the chief had one such union. He promised to keep the child safe. His weak will saw that the matriarch found out about the child and forced her brother to accompany her as she tracked the mother down. She ran for days but eventually the matriarch and her pathetic sibling caught up with her. On the rocky plains she gave her child to a band of adventurers moments before the Axe of the Betrayed was thrown into her back by her former lover. She died from the wound but not before seeing the confused half orc hand her child over to the matriarch. She watched as it was killed. The axe was left in her back but she would not stay dead. She arose as a Revenant the next night and buried her pup properly. Using her new undead powers the gnoll mother destroyed her former tribe and tracked the band of adventurers in the southern swamps. She was destroyed and her axe taken. Though she still seeks vengeance the Axe has found new owners. The axe itself is magical now and where as it was used to cause great suffering and betrayal the powers that inhabit it seek to right wrongs instead. The axe becomes a +1 weapon against any foe who has attacked a companion of its wielder. This bonus also is gained if the wielder has seen the target harm an innocent. The axe deals 2d12 instead of 1d12 if a companion is reduced to 0 hit points but only on the wielders next turn and on the target causing the damage. (once per turn) If the wielder is seeking to bring justice to a betrayer the axes power truly shines.

Treasured in areas where Salamanders are a threat to the populace."},{"name":"Dragon Powder","type":"Creature Bits","description":" In spite of its name, this highly combustible powder is not harvested from dragons, but rather several species of fire breathing wyverns. Consisting of rapidly decayed poison as was only recently discovered through research into the evolution of these species, the powder is excreted through the mouth, where the creature\u0027s saliva protects it from the adverse effects. When kept most, the outer layer of a ball of the powder will become crusted and hard. When consequently broken open against a solid surface, the resulting explosion created by the expanding and combusting powder will deal mainly force damage to all in the area. Due to the difficulty of harvesting and storing the powder safely the select few that purchase it do so at a high price. While unconfirmed, several wizards have stated that using the powder as the material component for the \"fireball\" spell is not only possible, but also greatly enhances it\u0027s effects."},{"name":"Backhand Striker","type":"Longsword","description":" This longsword has been crafted with a short blade on the end of the pommel.

The stuff of shadows constantly coalesces and drips from the tip of the spear. If the spear even scratches an enemy, this dark essence can be used to form a necromantic link between the wielder and the victim. Once per long rest, the wielder of this weapon may activate its special property after successfully striking a target with the spear. Until the end of the encounter, whenever the wielder of the spiteful spear takes damage the target also takes 2 points of damage. This damage is of the same damage type as the attack on the wielder."},{"name":"Sazaran\u0027s Spice Rack","type":"Tools / Supplies","description":" A small wooden rack that, curiously, only has room for one jar. The jar that comes with this rack is empty. Away from the rack the jar is completely ordinary, it is merely a receptacle for the magic of the rack. To use the power of the spice rack, the lid of the jar must be removed and any spice or edible herb named. The jar immediately fills with the named flavouring. The contents are enough to flavour a single meal for up to ten people. Naming a second spice or herb replaces the contents. Spices and herbs already named can be re-summoned but the amount in the jar will be reduced by the amount previously used. The capacity of the jar for each spice or herb refills after a long rest. No matter the amount used, no flavouring created by the spice rack has the capacity to poison, even if it normally would when ingested in large doses. The spice rack simply cannot create any herb which is inedible. A person may be attuned to this item; if so attuned they can use the spice rack for its real purpose: effectively, an innocuous poisoner\u0027s kit. The attuned rack will happily create poisonous herbs for its owner, and any edible herb that is actually poisonous in high doses is now no longer safe when ingested in large amounts."},{"name":"Superabundant Spice Rack","type":"Supplies","description":" The original magical spice rack used by Sazaran the Assassin was much admired by a number of people who had no idea of its true purpose, and it inspired imitations.

It is exactly as it seems, and cannot be attuned to create poisons."},{"name":"Shortrope\u0027s quick fingers","type":"Armour","description":" These black leather gloves give the wearer advantage on all lock picking attempts.

It won\u0027t rest until it has obtained new gold every day.

It can be removed with a Remove Curse spell."},{"name":"The Sword of Bawking","type":"Magical Weapon","description":" The Sword of Bawking is best presented among many seemingly normal chickens. It begins as a simple chicken that appears nothing more than dinner. However, when it senses danger for the person who last fed it, it hops up and transforms into a powerful sword. Its head becomes the pommel, its neck the grip, its wings the guard, and its legs fuse to become the long blade. It functions as a (insert enchantment level) longsword until all the danger is dispelled, at which point it turns into a normal chicken once more and acts as if nothing ever happened. If bred with another of its species, it\u0027s chicks will transform into daggers in the same manner."},{"name":"Bloody Cultist Coinage","type":"Currency","description":" A number of shimmering rose-gold disks about an inch in diameter, and thicker than an average coin.

For many weeks on end he worked, weaving subtle magic between and among his stitches. Once the shining brass buckles are secured, the wearer of these boots will never tire from traveling on foot. The boots do not dirty from the dust of the road, nor do they ever seem to wear out. However, before he gave the boots to Adele, Corneli\u0027s jealous rival, the Enchanter Aneu, cursed them with a dread bewitchment. Whenever the wearer attempts to move at a faster pace than a walk, the buckles will come unclasped, causing them to stumble and fall. Corneli - who knew nothing of the curse - gave the boots to Adele on the day of her departure. The two lovers took a bit too long saying their goodbyes, and so she was forced to hurry to catch up with the other pilgrims. As she ran across the Red River Bridge, Aneu\u0027s enchantment took effect, and she fell off into the water and drowned. Corneli was heartbroken, and buried Adele\u0027s body by the bridge where she died. He never forgave himself for what he thought was his own failure. He threw the boots into the river, and vowed to never work magic ever again."},{"name":"A Jar of Dirt","type":"Better than Nothing Magical Item","description":" A glass jar that is always filled with dirt.

It holds five charges and regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn. The wearer of the glove can expend a charge by saying the command word while touching a liquid container with the gloved hand. Once they do so, the glove begins to glow faintly and the patterns shift across the glove’s surface. The wearer then holds a palm-sized comestible (or several of the same comestibles in an equivalent volume) in the gloved hand and squeezes.

When a charge is used after casting a spell that requires a saving throw with the staff as an arcane focus all forms of advantage are cancelled and all targets have disadvantage on their saving throw. Legendary Resistance may still be used. If all charges on the staff are expended then it shatters and it is destroyed at all points in its timeline, which is convoluted and strange, it reforms three months later at all points along its timeline. Due to the convoluted nature of time with the staff there may be multiple versions of the staff in existence at the same time, which will instantly shatter if touched together. In order to permanently destroy the staff some way must be found to seclude two of them from the stream of time and then touch them together.

So, let\u0027s make some loot! The loot doesn\u0027t necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase as an accessory to their equipment or wardrobe.

So, the Indestructible Prayer Book was created to help traveling clerics, healers, and other holy types not have to worry about such things. The book is waterproof, flameproof, and tear proof. And the pages are illuminated with a soft light, so one could even read the book in the darkest of places. Plus, as an added bonus, if you tell it what prayer you\u0027re looking for specifically. it will open to that prayer by itself, so you don\u0027t have to fumble with pages while performing a ceremony. Admittedly these books are expensive, which is why they are usually reserved for the upper echelons of the church, but they are sometimes gifted to special priests as rewards for some great deed performed for the church."},{"name":"Elixir of Feign Death","type":"Potion","description":" It is said that many millennium ago there lived a priestess whose beauty surpassed the god\u0027s. Men fell quickly at her feet, but none so much as an old wretched king. To avoid her fate in his harem, she concocted a vial that could bring death temporarily, only long enough to escape her peril. It is now sold as a prayer item, immortalizing innocence and occasionally used to get out of a bind."},{"name":"The All-Seeing Cauldron","type":"Mundane","description":" A copper cauldron carved with eyes on the outside, and teeth on the inside.

The stone glows warm when it is touching the skin of a man or woman who has committed the specific sin the stone is attuned to. Unfortunately, the more useful SinStones, such as the MurderStone and the TheftStone have been found and hoarded by nobles. The only stones that one would still encounter in the wild are decidedly less useful, and reflect the values of the ancient religion.

After consuming the potion all past social encounters with the first person he or she sees will magically seem hazy and forgotten, essentially treating the first person seen as someone they just met for the first time. The drinker does not forget past interactions, but the events seem faint and no longer hold any away on the opinion of the person. Useful as a reset button in relations with someone else, but also has mischievous possibilities. The drink looks, smells, and tastes exactly like red wine."},{"name":"Pearls of Piety","type":"Prayer Beads","description":" This string of large pearl-like stones radiate with light and warmth when the holder\u0027s prayers are heard by their deity. There is no guarantee that the prayer will be answered, however."},{"name":"Tome of Remembrance","type":"Prayer Book","description":" This small, leather-bound book is created empty, each page filling with the prayers of it\u0027s owner as they are are offered to their god.

Another clear bead of glass added to the string will turn yellow 24 hours after it is added and begin to light on the day where it appears in the sequence.

It is normally worn over an alb or other vestment. It is made of a fine silken fabric and has upon it sewn various divine symbols, vertically down each side of the stole. When worn, the wearer may touch the various symbols, even very lightly, to recreate one of the features of the cantrip Thaumaturgy, providing a veritable special effects board of public speaking tricks. This device works for anyone wearing it, not just clerics. Three of its features may be active at once. One wonders why a cleric would have needed such a thing to be created. Hmm."},{"name":"Scythe of a Death God","type":"Scythe","description":" This is the Scythe that lies in the Necropolis. It is lies in wait to be wielded by the champion. This scythe has a blade of the purest obsidian and a handle made of dark iron wood.

Any who remove one of these amulets that are made of pure silver, has disadvantage on checks and saving throws related to a skill of the DM\u0027s Chosing until the amulet is returned to the Necropolis.

It\u0027s animated, and can talk to whoever holds it."},{"name":"Divining Dice","type":"Dice used for fortune telling","description":" Three dice with various markings carved of bone, one of dragon, one of beholder, and one of unicorn.

There is no curse that keeps the helmet on."},{"name":"Trial of Faith","type":"Instrument of Self Flagellation","description":" This is a beautifully ornate whip with multiple lashings, each tipped with a hooked barb, and designed for self-mortification. The devout of some religious orders will use these whips to lash themselves as penance to atone for their sins.

An item placed into a pocket will take up the expected amount of space in the pocket, but from the outside will appear flat as if empty.

In the center is a slight indentation, polished mirror smooth from countless thumbs rubbing circles over the aeons. Many claim that catching their own reflection in this divot brings a sense of serenity and peace of mind."},{"name":"Holy Cast","type":"Tool","description":" This item appears to be just a normal block of bronze at first glance. Upon closer inspection however, a seam down the center becomes apparent. With a modicum of force it will split into two halves, revealing the inverse reliefs of each side of a holy symbol."},{"name":"What sorts of reading material do we find?","type":"The rusty hinges that bind the book creak in protest as you open the cover. The yellowing paper is ancient and frail in your hands. The ink has faded to brown, but the words are still legible...","description":" I use books and scrolls to give pieces of lore about the world to my players. They are also a great way to throw in a healthy dose of jokes and humor without making cartoonish NPCs. Scrolls don\u0027t necessarily have to contain a stored spell, they are just single-page documents (of variable length) written on rolled parchment. So, let\u0027s write some books and scrolls! The loot doesn\u0027t necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase to read now or later. These should be mostly mechanics free. If you are experiencing writer\u0027s block, roll on these books tables to generate a topic. I\u0027ll post a few examples."},{"name":"The Argentine Manual Of Arms For Noble Gentlemen","type":"A Fencing Manual","description":" A handsome volume, bound in decorated leather, with an inlaid picture of two men in court dress duelling with thin rapiers. The book details a complete fencing style specifically for court duels. It is lavishly decorated with beautiful illustrations of the positions and techniques of the Argentine style. It is not particularly suited to warfare or dungeon delving, but will allow you to avenge insults to a lady\u0027s honour while retaining your courtly poise."},{"name":"The God Text","type":"their","description":" On the side of a mountain is a large sheer flat section, atop a treacherous scree slope. Whether the side of the mountain fell long ago and was carved later or, as legends suggest, the rock fell revealing the already existing words underneath, is unknown. The letters are five feet hight, carved the length of a tall man\u0027s arm into the rock, and are astoundingly smooth. The nesting birds that use every crook and crevice in the rock for miles around won\u0027t go anywhere near the words. The language is unknown. The letters are regular and square, grouped into words that are only ever four, eight, or sixteen letters long. The number of letters is disputed; some scholars classify subtle differences between carvings as being entirely different letters, others simply as variations. The most common counts are eighteen and thirty-two. Half of the bottom sixteen lines of text are taken up with a single, gigantic, four-letter word, carved twice as deep into the rock as the other letters. There are scrolls of the God Text found all over. They are often kept in ornately decorated scroll-cases made of precious metals. The scrolls themselves can be written on thin gold or silver foils. The letters might be embossed, or actually punched out. The accuracy of the transcription seems to change the effect it has on readers. Reading a copy of the God Text can lead people to drop everything in their lives and head towards the site of the original. Wizards studying the God Text have created new spells of astounding power and versatility. Adventurers have decoded the Text as a treasure map several times, leading to vastly far-flung places. Strangely, each time a powerful artefact of some kind has been found. One wizard claimed he was going to use the God Text as the basis for a Golem, but nothing has been heard from him, or his city, since then."},{"name":"Corin Tasslefoot\u0027s recipe book","type":"A homely book of cooking tips","description":" A simply bound book decorated with a border of green vines. The book is a set of family recipes from a humble halfling farmer. He wrote down recipes from his extended family, including his great-grandmother. The meals are generally wholesome rustic food but despite that are delicious, filling, and sustaining. There are a number of recipes for travel food, from way bread and travel rations to making a good meal from the land."},{"name":"The Pillow Book of Date Momoko","type":"A beautifully illustrated scroll that you wouldn\u0027t take home to your mother","description":" I can\u0027t actually tell you much about this. Look, it\u0027s beautifully created, written on exquisitely prepared paper and the illustrations are exquisite. But let\u0027s just say that people have been known to spontaneously combust while reading it. The Hight Priest of Eros said it was \"a bit much\". The High Priestess ran off with her copy and hasn\u0027t been seen since. However, if there are questions about bedroom ... matters that you wish addressed, well, somewhere in this scroll I\u0027m sure it will be. In detail. With diagrams. And, some say, maths. There\u0027s supposed to be a story running throughout, of a young bride-to-be asking her female relatives for advice on her upcoming wedding night. I wouldn\u0027t know. I\u0027ve only ever handled it while wearing oven gloves and a blindfold."},{"name":"The Love Poetry of Dryads","type":"New edition of an old book of poems","description":" Chock full of translations from ancient and modern Sylvan, this bark-bound book is a little rough in your hands, and according to verse #163, that\u0027s how the dryads like it. However, verse #77 suggests a gentle rustle through her leaves will set her desire ablaze. It\u0027s all more complicated than peasant girls, so be careful when trying to make a move on your prickly lady friend. This edition has a new forward written by the celebrated elvish bard Lorendel Woodswhisper."},{"name":"The Ballad of Barrik and Theda","type":"New book recounting old dwarvish tales","description":" This new book from the dwarvish historian Torgrim Stonehalter recounts in vivid detail the doomed adventures of Barrik and Theda the legendary dwarvish heroes and lovers of a past age. Stonehalter presents new evidence—found in the ruins of the library at Tornikkberg—that Theda was indeed the real leader of the duo, taking initiative in slaying the dragon Baazthys, and that Barrik\u0027s devotion to Theda may not have been as unwavering as the tales and songs would have you believe."},{"name":"Royal Proclamation #248","type":"Old scroll","description":" This proclamation is nearly 300 years old, and it lays out King Haroldus\u0027s case for calling to action the Fourth Hunting of the Dwarves. There was only one other known copy of this proclamation that has survived the years, and it was stolen from the library it had been held in a few years ago. The roll of parchment is still intact and would fetch a good price from the right buyer."},{"name":"More Tales from Beyond the Veil","type":"Sequel to a popular religious book","description":" Brother Calymus takes us further into the Spirit Realm with a new collection of stories and essays to follow up his first. Each of these focuses on a first-hand account of the journey from life to death told to Calymus by a ghost, a resurrected individual or a soul called forth from the other realms. Critics suggest Calymus sensationalizes the tales a bit to make death sound more frightening than it is, to which he challenges them to explore death on their own and then come back to talk about it."},{"name":"Scroll of Rhythm","type":"Mostly useless magical scroll","description":" When someone versed in arcane magic reads this scroll, they can\u0027t help but start speaking in rhythm, snapping their fingers, and tapping their toes. The words start rhyme as the reader marks the time, and all those who are near can\u0027t resist the beat they hear. They start to bounce and dance as if they\u0027re in a trance. It only lasts a minute til the reader reaches the end. Then the scroll disappears, and all is as before."},{"name":"Unshameful Names for Your Child","type":"Parenting book","description":" After learning that his traditional Dwarven name is highly embarrassing to those who speak only Common, Shi\u0027Teater Stunck sought to ensure that no other child would suffer the same public ridicule as him. This book is the culmination of that work."},{"name":"Proper Methods of Dress, and Other Pressing Issues, Fourth Edition","type":"Etiquette guide","description":" This quaint text of Domoic origin goes into great detail on exactly how a gentleman or noblewoman of proper breeding should look, act, and think. Notably, more than fifty pages are dedicated to how many waistcoat buttons should be buttoned according to time of day. This edition begins with a blaring notice that, following the Petticoat Massacre, it is now considered an unforgivable faux pas to allow one\u0027s coattails to flap in the wind. A new sartorial device called a \"Tail Stiffener\" is essential for anyone wishing to make a good impression."},{"name":"fanwen\u0027s funney joaks","type":"Satirical publication","description":" Local troublemaker Fanwen Grist has discovered a lucrative career peddling his crude humor to the lower classes, selling new collections of jokes, lewd stories, and new slang whenever his coffers run a bit low. While writing this issue, Fanwen seems to have become particularly amused by the upper crust\u0027s recent obsession with an accessory called a \"Tail Stiffener.\""},{"name":"Untitled Poems of the Kywirk Gurr","type":"Anthropological artifact","description":" The 14 goatskin pages of this oversized, fur-bound tome contain the only known example of Yeti poetry, from a highly socialized band on the leeward side of the Bittersnap Mountains. Its topics include seasonal shifts, territorial disputes among bands, and prime hunting grounds. The language is idiosyncratic and pictographic in nature."},{"name":"Trimple, Primple, Prample and Zot","type":"Collected works of poetry","description":" This collection of works by Gilathil Greenleaf originally became madly popular exclusively among people who could not speak elvish, captivated by the poet\u0027s soothing rhymes, wondering what deep mysteries such beautiful language must contain. Those who know Elvish, of course, know that the poems are nothing more than meaningless gibberish, words made up exclusively for their aesthetic sound. The popularity of this book in human lands is yet another reason elves tend to look down upon \"lesser peoples.\""},{"name":"Great Musicians of the Modern Period","type":"An encyclopedia of famous bards","description":" This book is a veritable \"who\u0027s who\" of modern musicians, almost all of whom are still alive and trying to make a living today. Although thoroughly researched, the book suspiciously goes on at great length about one Aloysius Fernangeles Compodius VII, describing his musical style in flattering, flowery language. Also suspiciously, one of the most popular musicians in the region is consistently referred to as \"The Drunk,\" and his musical style described as \"crude fare for the masses.\""},{"name":"Kalathraxas and the Basilisk\u0027s Eye","type":"Fourth in a series of popular action novels","description":" Kalathraxas, The Good Necromancer, has succeeded in defeating the evil Pelfanus, but now he faces his greatest enemy: himself. Can Kal overcome the geas cast upon him by a rival wizard and prevent the Basilisk\u0027s Eye from falling into the wrong hands?"},{"name":"The Fall of the Haloan Empire","type":"Historical text","description":" On the surface, this appears to merely be a recounting of the opulent Haloan Empire\u0027s fall from power centuries ago. Some claim, however, that careful analysis reveals it as a scathing commentary on the notoriously corrupt court of King Judicus, written in code to keep the author from harm."},{"name":"Lelesh Voth","type":"A thick, bound book that is locked by magic","description":" This tome\u0027s title translates to Common as \"The Power of Pacifism.\" Should one find a way to open the book\u0027s magical lock, they will find that the book\u0027s pages have been carved out to make room for a magically sharp dagger with a golden hilt."},{"name":"Incomes \u0026 Expenditures, Council Treasury, vol. 343","type":"Financial record","description":" A relatively recent financial ledger, with hundreds of pages of densely-packed tables of numbers and brief descriptions. It would take weeks to comb through this information, even for someone with extensive knowledge of the Council\u0027s financial practices -- but surely there\u0027s no need to scrutinize things so closely."},{"name":"101 Magical Tips for the Busy Housewife","type":"Cheaply printed pamphlet","description":" The content of this pamphlet largely consists of its overly long introduction, which tells the reader how to harness \"mental magic\" and wield \"the ancient arts\" to maintain a tidier home. Despite these promises, the pamphlet teaches absolutely nothing that\u0027s magical in nature; rather, the final six pages are merely a hastily written list of general (and mundane) housekeeping tips, such as \"Sweep your entranceway daily, to keep dirt from getting tracked about the house.\" Several of the tips are duplicates, as well; the total number of unique tips is actually closer to eighty."},{"name":"On the Anatomy of Goblinoid Bodies","type":"Medical text","description":" An exhaustive exploration of the bodies of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, this is the life\u0027s work of Barber Stanwen Nolik. It appears highly reputable, but no other surgeon has ever been willing to replicate Nolik\u0027s work."},{"name":"The 13 Habits of Highly Effective Necromancers","type":"Self-help Scroll","description":" In The 13 Habits of Highly Effective Necromancers, author Stephanus D. Coeuvry presents a holistic, integrated, power-centered approach for solving problems with necromancy and the black arts. With dark humor and a blatant disregard for morality, Coeuvry reveals a step-by-step plan for raising your own undead army, plus tried and tested methods for handling standard problems like finding fresh corpses and dealing with pitchfork-wielding peasants."},{"name":"Leaves of Stone","type":"Bound stone slabs","description":" This \"book\" is really more of a door stop, though the author would likely priests it\u0027s use as such. Its stone pages are bound by think iron rings and engraved with the musings of the great dwarven poet Wilk Whetstone."},{"name":"The Herbalists Guide to Tea","type":"A small illustrated book","description":" This guide was complied by Anthony Crispaen, the Earl of Grey, who was an enthusiastic herbalist and alchemist. He collected all his findings and those of the druidic circles of Grey in his writings, illustrated by an artist passing through town by chance. Unfortunately the artist accidentally confused Lady\u0027s Smock with Nightshade, and the Earl died shortly after tea time the day he published the book."},{"name":"The Books of Fine...","type":"Sarcastic Non-Magical Books","description":" It all started with an Elven wit, who on a lark one day, took a book full of blank pages, and painted on the cover \"The Book of Fine Dwarven Poetry\", and displayed in on his mantle at home. A local bookseller was in the home one day and noticed the book, and thought that would be a fine way to sell some blank books to folks. A lot of elves loved the joke, and bought numerous copies to give to friends and family. Sure enough though, Dwarves visiting the city were not as happy with the book, and some decided to return the favor, and so they created their own blank paged book, called the \"Book of Fine Elven Craftsmanship.\" The Elves got quite insulted, and came out with a new blank paged book called the \"Book of Fine and Attractive Dwarven Women.\" Needless to say, other titles ensued in this war of blank paged books, with titles like \"Book of Fine and Non-Effeminate Elven Men\", \"Book of Fine and Bathed Dwarven Men\", \"Book of Fine and Non-Sheep Buggering Elves\", etc. After a few months, the war mercifully ground to an end, as both sides moved on to weightier issues. But, many of those blank paged tomes are still out there."},{"name":"A Treatise on Tortoises","type":"Religious Text","description":" The first twenty pages or so of this thin folio feature a selection of drawings, essays, and descriptions on and of the large saltwater tortoises that were once proliferant around the subtropical islands of the south. The following pages, however, seem to be written by a different hand, and while at first they follow the same structure, cryptic notes in the margins begin to overtake the text and illustrations, until they make up the entirety of the pages near the end of the book. The meaning of the notes - which largely consist of long strings of seemingly nonsense words - has been rigorously debated within the scholarly community, but at least four disparate religions and cults have been founded based on various interpretations of the text. Notably, all agree that the last page - which is naught but a tangle of scribbled, barely legible mass of ink - depicts the same thing; the face of a long dead God."},{"name":"Encyclopedia of the Anvil","type":"Book","description":" The Encyclopedia of the Anvil are a legendary collection of collected over the years by an unknown master Dwarven wizard. With typical Dwarven ingenuity and discipline, he applied himself to cataloging magic with the same intensity of focus that a master smith would bring to a life-long masterwork. Even to the untrained eye, this collection of 15 books (50 lbs total) appear to be of exceptional quality. Despite their antiquity, they are in exquisite condition. Each page is richly illuminated, with orderly black-on-white lettering interspersed with intricate geometric designs and diagrams."},{"name":"Wiki book of shared knowledge","type":"Magic book","description":" Few copies of this book exists and copies of it are mostly owned by most educated wizards and priests. When somebody writes something in this book, same text appears in all copies. They are used to share knowledge. Most of creatures and phenomena are described in it and owners are working hard to add new information. Because of that, book has been increasing in its size and weight, despite all the effort and shrinking spells."},{"name":"Bloody scroll","type":"Bleeding scroll","description":" This scroll has mostly gibberish on it. But when read aloud, blood runs out of it."},{"name":"Barbarian\u0027s cookbook","type":"Cooking book","description":" A book for illiterate cooks.

The description of a ring meant to imbue the element of fire to the wearer seems to stand out as the page has been dog-eared and seems worn. Another remarkable find is near the end of the book. It\u0027s a plain bone wand that is described as having \"petty and amateurish effects of prestidigitation and minor illusions,\" but off to the side, written in what seems to be a hastily scrawled ink, is the phrase \"death conquers all.\""},{"name":"The Tome of Current Thought","type":"Magical book","description":" As a person reads this book, the pages fill with a running record of whatever the reader happens to be thinking at the moment. For those who are unaware of what they\u0027re reading, this can be a terrifying experience as they see their own private thoughts wrought on the page. For instance, should the reader happen to recall an embarrassing memory, that would instantly appear. Oh dear, any horrible memory? Including the time mother caught me alone in the stables? Wait, how does this book know about the time mother caught me alone in the stables? Is this some sort of joke? Who wrote this? How do I stop this?"},{"name":"Pop-up Book of Monster Summoning","type":"Magic Book of summoning spells","description":" This thick, crude book has a roughly painted picture of various monsters on it\u0027s front cover. But when one opens it\u0027s pages, one finds various pop-up depictions of various natural creatures of the world. On the pages with the pop-up are a poem about the creature featured on those pages. Reading that poem will act as a Monster Summoning spell, summoning that creature to the reader, and placing it under his/her control. The creature sticks around for the standard duration of a monster summoning spell, and if it\u0027s \"killed\" during battle, it will return to the book, but that creature will be unable to be summoned for a week afterwards."},{"name":"The Sibylline Tomes Vol 4.","type":"????????","description":" A book of unknown contents.

Be it by pragmatism or waivers you too can learn how to raise the dead without damning yourself to the nine hells to be forever tortured by the souls of those you raised.

The chronicle itself passingly mentions a rumored treasure, artifact, or relic (commonly believed to be myth) as though its existence is fact. Upon closer inspection, the pages are lightly watermarked. When held up to light, terrains and landmarks appear, which anyone familiar with the region may recognize. As the pages are turned, the terrain appears to shift also, finally zooming in and settling on one particular spot, where on the final page the author seems to have accidentally dropped a bit of sealing wax."},{"name":"Book of all Knowledge","type":"Magical Book","description":" Bubistai the mage, created this large book with the image of a face on the front cover. Normally, the face\u0027s eyes and mouth are closed, but when Bubistai commanded it, the eyes would open and the mouth would start reciting something. But, it can only recite things written within it\u0027s pages, so Bubistai planned to write many important and significant things within it. And indeed, he wrote magic thesises, spell research notes, and historical facts about his life within it\u0027s covers. But, unfortunately he died within a couple years of creating the book, and it fell into the hands of his apprentice, who quickly started filling the book with all sorts of nonsense, such as limericks, erotic poems, and the occasional shopping list. So, while it\u0027s called the Book of All Knowledge, buyer beware!"},{"name":"The Book of Night","type":"Artifact Grimoire","description":" Describing the Book of Night is difficult, in no small part because looking directly at the artifact is nearly impossible. Casual glances slide straight over the Book; it is somewhat possible to get an understanding of what it looks like merely through peripheral vision, but only a concerted effort of extreme willpower can overcome this particular attribute. Once the witness\u0027 will has been asserted, however, the Book\u0027s appearance truly manifests itself. The cover is unmarked and black, neither matte nor glossy; simply black. The surface is, furthermore, adorned with silver points of varying size. Should one attempt to move the Book, they will notice that these silver markings move--or, rather, remain fixed relative to the position of the Book. When they reach the edge of the cover, they vanish, and are replaced by others that appear on the opposite edge. A particularly astute observer will note that, when held aloft and compared to the night sky, the markings match the positions of visible stars."},{"name":"The Oldest","type":"Inscribed bark tablets","description":" The Oldest, or, to use its most proper name, The Oldest Existing Writing On Record, is a series of rectangular tablets, seemingly fashioned from tree bark. The bark is from no tree that yet lives; druidic lore and wizardly knowledge alike fail when confronted by it. The one time a Dryad was consulted, she spent the remainder of the day with bowed head, murmuring something not unlike a prayer. The writing itself is shockingly refined and crisp, despite being so old. The lettering is simultaneously foreign and familiar, with elements of most known scripts found in it somewhere. So far, only select words and phrases have been translated, mostly due to their similarity to one or more extant languages, and the translations have been rudimentary at best. The actual vocalization of this language is completely unknown."},{"name":"Aerlin\u0027s Heirloom","type":"A great, ornate tome in a locked case","description":" This case is an elaborate box guarded by a very complicated lock (DC 20) Through a window of unbreakable glass a huge tome can be seen, bound in leather and trimmed in gold and jewels with an elaborate crest on the cover. The first page of the book is an exquisite etched plate print of a very elderly looking elf nobleman with the name Tabarus Now\u0027nathal scribed under it, and inside the cover is a simple inscription: From All of Us. The next plate is an etching of an elderly elf woman. Neanna Now\u0027nathal, wife. Then three more plates of his two sons and his daughter. Then his seven grandchildren, and his 27 great grandchildren. The faces get younger as the book goes on and it goes for 689 pages until it ends on a picture of a baby elf girl titled Nelonna Artenala, sixth great granddaughter."},{"name":"Grimoire of Spectral Critters","type":"Spellbook","description":" As you open the smoking, luminescent tome, you feel a rush of energy overcome you. The book turns to mist in your hands. If the reader of this book can cast at least one spell, he or she learns Spectral Critter (and can cast it 1/day). If the reader cannot cast a spell, the book is destroyed and nothing happens."},{"name":"On the Hunting of Fauna and Fowl in the Baldred Mountains: Ed. II","type":"A guide to the natural inhabitants of the Baldred Mountains","description":" A plain text, sturdily made, with an embossed leather cover. It details the hunting, preparing and cooking of most animals to be found in the aforementioned mountains. The first edition was rather controversial, I fear, because the author included recipes that contained aarakocra and various forms of fey."},{"name":"Mincing Vellum","type":"A Scroll of Intimate Scrying","description":" The simple dusty scroll has no marking, seal nor text on it. By all appearances, it is a standard sheet of writing material that is bound by a single silver thread. When placed on another person\u0027s body, one who is skilled in magic can press their face into and through the surface of the peering directly into the persons soul much as one might peer into a body of water. In fact the caster cannot breath while using this scroll, so it is limited by how long the user can hold his or her breath, or by how long the person is willing to tolerate such an intrusion. When peering into another, you may see many thing: bitterness manifesting itself as an adder\u0027s bite, the true disposition of the soul that may even be a mystery to the person whom you are looking into, spirits that may be taking refuge within the person, or are perhaps there for more malign purposes. The scroll has had many names over the years, such as Ryon\u0027s Mirror, and Gorfellow\u0027s Embrace. Those who use it should be forewarned that looking directly into a person\u0027s soul in this manner could have dire effects on a person\u0027s sanity, and it has been noted that Arghul, a promising young mage drowned when he used it and found that he was looking into a truly beatific soul and lost all notion of time and perspective and even his need for air. A pity, really. So promising."},{"name":"The Most Piteous Story of Garum Thornswallow","type":"Gray Leather-Bound Book","description":" This short history follow the life and exploits of Garum Thornswall, a mediocre sorcerer by all accounts who lived an average, but that came to a very dolorous end. Account however vary on the very last details of his life and how he in fact met his end. The book itself rarely agrees, telling a new story to every reader with the seeming intent to cause the greatest feelings sadness and pity that they may extract from the reader. Only the most cold-hearted readers of the tome have read it without it eliciting a tear, while others are haunted by the sadness for the rest of their days by the tale. It is unknown how a sorcerer of such middling talent could have wrought such a device, and it is also unknown how many, or if in fact any of the tales told within it are true. It is also impossible to to tell with any reasonable degree of certainty how Garum met his end. It is known, however, that this was the last and most notable of his bequeathed creations."},{"name":"What prizes do these bilge rats carry?","type":"The tattered map leads you across the barren island to a lone palm, where a bit of flotsam nearly obscures a weatherbeaten chest...","description":" Last time, we found ourselves exploring some seedy undersides, which got me thinking about pirates, ships, and nautical ephemera. Today, let\u0027s write about things you might pillage from a galleon, or uncover while looting a sea baron\u0027s stronghold. Spoils await! The loot doesn\u0027t necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to pick it up carry or purchase as an accessory to their equipment or wardrobe. These should be mostly mechanics free. I\u0027ll post a few examples."},{"name":"Tiny Crystal Ship in a Bottle","type":"Misc (or is it?)","description":" A tiny sailing ship made of fine crystal inside a bottle with no clear way it got in there.

The crew was forced to eat the cat, but kept this pelvic girdle as a reminder of her sacrifice."},{"name":"Stirgemeat\u0027s Sextant","type":"Magical Navigational Tool","description":" At first sight, it\u0027s unclear what the sextant is meant to be. Crafted from tarnished brass, badly tanned leather, crudely shaped driftwood and milky glass, it\u0027s a tool only a seasoned mariner could appreciate, much less love. And yet, over the years various sailors have added their own touches - a bundle of pigeon feathers tied with sinew to a thumbscrew, a rough etching of a stylized Kraken, an extra mirror. Its last owner (a burly gnomish privateer, the eponymous Stirgemeat) claimed to have enchanted it with the power to sight in on the Maiden\u0027s star even during the brightest day or stormiest night."},{"name":"Mr. Mizzen\u0027s Mate\u0027s Candle","type":"Minor Magical Item","description":" Sold as part of the otherwise wildly successful \u0027Mr. Mizzen!\u0027 line of sailor\u0027s tools, the Mate\u0027s Candle was designed to serve as a replacement timepiece and light source for sailors that served the night\u0027s watch. If lit at dusk, the thin candles would burn until the next dawn, changing colors at the top of every hour as they did so. Unfortunately, the engineers at Mr. Mizzen didn\u0027t take the typical sailor\u0027s superstitious nature into account, and the candles failed to sell well, especially after stories of \u0027demon ships\u0027 bathed in red, orange and green lights began to circulate. A second batch of Mate\u0027s Candle was sold, marketed with \u0027sailor friendly\u0027 shades of white, yellow and gold, but the damage had been done. Still, many of the candles have been repurposed by cults looking for mood lighting, watchmen in coastal cities, and thrifty students."},{"name":"Drowned Shot","type":"Ammunition","description":" The Slipscrew Rigs off the southern coast have been rumored to be the haunt of (in no particular order) Mergnomes, Mechoctopi, Mutamphibians, and/or Metanthopods, depending on what port you\u0027re hailing from, and how gullible you look. Regardless, most agree that the rigs\u0027 deep shale oil - shipped all along the coast in tight, cotton-wrapped bamboo casks to whoever can afford it - is some of the best on the market. Less well known is a byproduct of the drilling, flammable, dense stone known by mariners as Drowned Chull. When dried, it can be chipped, carved and shaped into pellets suitable for small cannon or flintlock longarms. While less durable than iron or lead shot, drowned shot has the advantage of being innately flammable, and has been used (with mixed effectiveness) to set sails, unwashed hair and powder stores alight."},{"name":"Mr. Mizzen\u0027s Meticulous Mainsail","type":"Minor Magical Item","description":" Cut and sewn from blessed canvas, this sail repels water, dust, grime and dirt for up to (a guaranteed!) two years before the blessing fades, and the cloth becomes mundane (if perfectly serviceable). Often sold as part of a package, each sail is shipped in one of five set sizes, but can be custom altered for a nominal fee."},{"name":"Orkish Cutlass","type":"Mundane weapon","description":" A thin, jagged sword favored by the orc reavers who terrorize the fishermen and traders of the northern coasts. Most orkish cutlasses don\u0027t last long, as the jagged edges and constant exposure to sea-spray cause the steel to rust. As such, many orc reavers carry two or three on raids."},{"name":"Lucky Coin of Captain Cray","type":"Possibly wondrous item","description":" The legendary pirate Captain Cray was known for flipping a large gold coin to decide the fate of his captives. One side of the coin is shiny and reflective and the other dark and tarnished and black. If the shiny side came up, you got a piece of steel across your throat. If the dark side came up, you got some stones tied to your feet and were given to the sea. Rumors tell that the coin aided Captain Cray with his uncanny nose for finding fantastic treasure hoards, but no one is certain how that worked..."},{"name":"The Captain\u0027s \u0027Special\u0027 Rum Cocktail","type":"Booze","description":" A loose paper label on the glass flask marks this as the \"Captain\u0027s \u0027Special\u0027 Rum Cocktail\u0027.

Exactly what makes it special, is not clear."},{"name":"Wooden Puzzle Box","type":"Storage/Magical Item","description":" This small box is the size of two fists, and covered with numerous tiny drawers. Only two of the drawers will open, but by manipulating those two drawers and sliding other cleverly hidden sections of wood, eventually you may figure out how to open all the drawers. But it may take some time. Each drawer holds it\u0027s own tiny treasure (rings, tiny notes, a gem, a living butterfly etc). The box cannot be damaged or forced in any way."},{"name":"Ivory Mermaids","type":"Trinket","description":" A selection of ivory mermaids, crudely carved. Well, except for certain \u0027features\u0027 which have been carved with lavish detail."},{"name":"Pirate Head Clay Pipe","type":"Utensil","description":" A very fine clay pipe, the bowl formed into the shape of a bearded man with a scarred face.

Beneath is the name \u0027Celia\u0027 and a few badly worn sentences that might explain her fate, but the words are very hard to read."},{"name":"Wooden Mug","type":"Utensil","description":" This is an ordinary wooden mug. Except for the hidden compartment at the bottom, which can be triggered by pressing part of the handle while squeezing the sides. Why would they put a hidden compartment inside the cup?"},{"name":"The Watchman\u0027s Friend","type":"Jewellery","description":" The metal torc looks rather severe, with several upward-facing spikes. It would be very difficult to nod off when wearing such a serious piece of jewellery."},{"name":"Miskin\u0027s Stash","type":"?","description":" A tube of bamboo has been carefully sealed at both ends with wax.

The carving is good quality so it might have value."},{"name":"Pearl Marbles","type":"Trinket","description":" A bag of milky white marbles with long swirls of pale pinks, reds, blues, greens, and purples decorating them. Though not made from real pearls, they reflect light in a vaguely enchanting manner. On the seas, sailors would trade marbles and similar trinkets as a form of currency, getting favors from one another or what not. Some captains even paid their mean in marbles and bead, though this often did not go over well once on land."},{"name":"Jelly Roger\u0027s Marmelade","type":"Food","description":" Old jars containing orange and red fruit preserves. A rough and jolly swashbuckler is imprinted on the lid. Along the side is written \"To prevent scurvy on the high seas!\""},{"name":"Seastone Chalice","type":"Magic Item","description":" This two-handled drinking cup is wrought from some sort of pale blue-green material and inlaid with gold. The outside is rimed with salt crystals which regenerate when brushed away, but these don\u0027t seem to affect the chalice itself. When water is placed into the cup, it is instantly rendered salty and undrinkable. In addition, the cup produces deafening sounds of surf until it is emptied. Non-water beverages, such as alcohol, milk, juice, etc. are unaffected."},{"name":"Dread Corsair\u0027s Beard-Braids","type":"Magical item","description":" These bits of colored string are meant for use in braiding hair, usually of a beard, mustache, or ponytail. When used in this manner, they remain inert until the command word is spoken, usually \"AVAST!\" or something suitably piratey. Under these circumstances, the ends of the strings smolder and catch fire, creating a hellish glow over the wearer\u0027s face."},{"name":"Affinity coin","type":"Magical coin","description":" This coin has an affinity for other coins, and will glow brighter and brighter as it gets closer to them. Useful for looking for hidden booty on a captured ship, or where someone might be hiding coins upon their person."},{"name":"Ol\u0027 Carbunkle.","type":"Magical Figurehead","description":" An old ship\u0027s figurehead, carved from white wood and splintered at the base. It depicts an aged man leaning forward and cupping an ear, as if listening intently for threats. An old smuggler\u0027s tale is that if you find and attach Ol\u0027 Carbunkle to your ship, you\u0027ll never be bothered by pesky lawsmen as you slink in or out of port. Given that Ol\u0027 Carbunkle\u0027s is currently mounted above the door to the Naval Guardsman\u0027s Barracks, take the story with a pinch of salt."},{"name":"Sahuagin Spear","type":"any","description":" These spears often drift ashore after the merlings and their ancient enemies have gotten good and riled enough to have a battle. Savvy grifters can re-sell them to lubbers as magical treasures of the sea."},{"name":"Gold-eater\u0027s Shell","type":"Tiny Beast","description":" This small, ornate shell fits in the palm of your hand. The shell itself appears to be made of silver, with what appears to be streaks of various precious minerals streaking through it. At first glance, it appears to be empty and would likely fetch some decent coin. Inside the shell however, lies a very small hermit crab with very expensive tastes. When the crab feels safe, it will set off to find it\u0027s favourite meal: gold (coins or otherwise). The shell shifts steadily from silver to gold over time as it gorges itself on more riches."},{"name":"Seahorse statuette","type":"Tiny Beast/Tiny Statue","description":" This small seahorse figurine appears to be made of solid gold, with brilliant sapphires for eyes. When removed from the water for extended periods of time, the gold begins to soften and liquefy as though melting off of the statuette. If the statuette is not returned to the water in time, the polished golden skin and sapphire eyes fade, leaving a normal (and live) seahorse in its place. Once returned to the water, the seahorse slowly crystallizes back to its statuette state but will rapidly try to escape its captors before it does so."},{"name":"Dwarven Mastbreaker","type":"Magical item of sabotage","description":" Resembling a collar for giant animals, this particularly mischievous item is comprised of two large halves, hinged in the middle. It is masterfully sculpted out of gold and decorated with several Dwarven runes. When clasped around the mast of a ship, the runes glow orange and a soft humming sound can barely be heard as the device slowly spins around the outside of the mast. After about an hour, the device will have cut through any mast, and the mast will fall, possibly on the ship itself. Perfect for sabotage!"},{"name":"The Compass of Captain Bloodbeard","type":"Ornate compass crafted from Obsidian","description":" A small item but still large for a compass it is wrapped in a box made from Obsidian. Minor details adorn the outside of this volcanic glass and make it very visually appealing. There are rumours that it can lead to great treasure but it only seems to function as a normal compass."},{"name":"Treasure of the Lost Deep","type":"Vast wealth with scattered magical items","description":" Ships sink all across the ocean, those carrying treasure are often scavenged with the help of mages but no treasure is ever found.

Some say it always keeps the wind to your backs."},{"name":"TriHorn Hat","type":"Magical Hat","description":" This Tricorn hat fits snugly onto it\u0027s wearer\u0027s head, and will stay on, despite wind, rain, strong tugging, or any other physical method attempted to remove it. The wearer can remove it anytime they want though. On command, the hat will sprout three horns, one on each corner, which the wearer can use for a goring attack, or due to the sharpness of the points, as a slashing attack. Standard non-proficiency penalties apply, but most users hide it\u0027s special power to use in a surprise attack sort of situation, thus mitigating the penalties with a surprise bonus."},{"name":"TriBlade Hat","type":"Clockwork hat","description":" This Tricorn hat, made out of gears, springs and cogs, is heavier than your normal Tricorn hat, and has a thick leather strap that fastens around the wearers chin. The hat consists of two parts, a skullcap rests snuggly on the wearers head, while the bulk of the hat is attached to the skullcap. Upon command, a blade folds out from each of the corners of the hat, and the hat starts rotating around the skullcap, lifting the wearer aloft, so the user can slowly fly, changing direction/altitude by head movements. The hat uses oil as fuel, and can fly for about 10 minutes before running out of fuel."},{"name":"Portable Cannon","type":"Magical Item","description":" It looks like any normal flintlock pistol, but instead of firing a small bullet, it fires a full sized cannonball."},{"name":"Tentacle Pendant","type":"Jewelry","description":" A copper pendant which resembles the tentacles of an octopus.

It enhances cold spells cast using it as a wand."},{"name":"Cheater\u0027s Dice","type":"Mundane Item","description":" This small bag is filled with many-sided dice. Most of them are weighted to bring up high rolls frequently."},{"name":"Trusted Lantern","type":"Minor Magical Item","description":" This lantern continues to burn while under water. Its light is not impeded by water, whether it be rain or sea."},{"name":"\"Specialty\" Cards","type":"Mundane Item","description":" These cards feature intricate and often very sexually explicit drawings to indicate suit and number. They have women, men, elves, kobolds.... Hey man, don\u0027t judge."},{"name":"Mr. Bones","type":"NPC","description":" Cursed with immortality and unabatable greed Mr.Bones locked himself with the treasure when the ship was sinking. Now, free at last and armed with 10,000 gp and a keen entrepreneurial mind, Mr. Bones is off to start his mercantile empire, but he will never forget the kindness the party has done him by opening the chest."},{"name":"Flux Capacitor","type":"Technology","description":" Looks like nothing more than a cylinder with some pretty lights. A cheap bauble"},{"name":"Rod of Winds Seas","type":"Magic Item","description":" What at first looks like a piece of the mystical Rod of Winds reveals itself to be a crude replica made of flotsam by clumsy triton hands. Some tritons will pay a hefty sum for the piece. Most will just laugh in the party’s face"},{"name":"C\u0026D","type":"Mundane item","description":" A letter from the local guard captain asking the pirate captain to cease and desist"},{"name":"Empty Chest","type":"Mundane item","description":" The chest is empty but is completely dry inside and proves to be completely water-tight"},{"name":"Pineapple Express","type":"Mundane Item","description":" A green leafy substance fills the chest. You can make out the words “Pineapple Express” embossed on the lid of the chest"},{"name":"Skull of Gravy Jones","type":"Magic Item","description":" Inside is the skull of the legendary ship’s cook Gravy Jones. It is said adding the skull to any tub of gravy will make it “the best gravy in the seven seas”"},{"name":"666 Gold Pieces","type":"Mundane item","description":" It’s just a number. You should be fine…"},{"name":"Bag of Winds","type":"Magic Item","description":" A leather satchel which can be opened to produce a directed gust of wind. Said to be how the Dread Pirate Bartholomew Jafferjabs could achieve such speed when he preyed upon merchant ships in the doldrums"},{"name":"Conch of Hearing","type":"Wondrous item (shell)","description":" Many legends speak of the Conch of Hearing, buried deep in the ocean floor. Other than the slight purple shimmer on the creamy surface of the shell, it appears as an ordinary shell. However, at a command word, it is said that one can hear through far distances if the conch is put to one\u0027s ear. There is nothing that one cannot hear with the Conch of Hearing."},{"name":"Galdur\u0027s Globe of Geodesy","type":"Tool","description":" This metal globe appears at first glance to be nothing more than an apprentice cartographer\u0027s failed attempt, full of glaring inaccuracies. But once installed in a ship\u0027s helm, one need only envision a place and the globe rotates to highlight the shortest naval route route there, or as close to the location as the ship can sail. It also displays accurate oversea distances along the route, particularly useful for crews in poorly charted waters or with limited rations and supplies."},{"name":"First Mate\u0027s Mug","type":"Misc","description":" This medium ceramic mug is an odd, almost organic looking shape, ostensibly fragile and unstable. Upon closer examination, the mug seems seems nigh indestructible, and when filled with liquid, stays perfectly upright on any surface, although it will move around."},{"name":"So, what are we drinking tonight?","type":"THIRSTY","description":" Fermented drinks are so much more than something to sip or to chug to unwind at the end of a busy adventuring day. Each tells a story of the brewer, vintner, or distiller who carefully crafted it. In a fantasy setting, some of these may come with magical effects, akin to a potion, but others are simply magical to experience. So, let\u0027s write some ales, wines, and other spirits! The loot doesn\u0027t necessarily have to magical, but it should be interesting enough to appeal to some PCs—anything a PC might want to purchase for a long journey or pay a little extra to enjoy on premises at a pub. These should be mostly mechanics free."},{"name":"Gnollblood Mead","type":"Nonmagical mead","description":" While the inventor of this recipe is said to have been human, anyone is welcome to make it- if they can survive the trial of getting the ingredients. True to its name, after the mead is sweetened with honey and boiled with a blend of spices, the maker stirs in just enough gnoll\u0027s blood to give the brew a salty, rusty undertone. This conveys no magical benefit, but it\u0027s still quite popular among the wealthy citizens of the local cities (the types who have never even seen a gnoll, let alone slayed one). Brewers within the city limits will pay handsomely for fresh gnoll carcasses to keep their blood supply in check."},{"name":"Bragget","type":"Goblin \"wine\"","description":" Made from fermented, often rotting cave mushrooms, bragget is the favored drink of any goblin who wants to quickly lose their inhibition. There\u0027s no real recipe to follow- simply throw a handful of fresh mushrooms into a vat of water, forget it for several months, rediscover the vat after a crew of adventurers break into your cave system, and drink it. Effects range from a gleeful, giddy state of inebriation to death from dysentery (or both)."},{"name":"Cobbler\u0027s Cream","type":"Rotgut, Swill","description":" Gnomes who dwell along the forest\u0027s edge often send their young to forage for meals in dense, semi-cultivated plots filled with berries, brambles, succulent flowers and herbs of all varieties. Having not yet developed a callous thick enough to endure the thorns, prickles and stings, many young Gnomes often wear carved wooden shoes and heavy leather gaiters to protect themselves. When a young Gnome reaches maturity, however, they are expected to retire their shoes back to the cobbler, where the toes are stuffed full of harvested berries, leaves, mushrooms and whatever else comes to hand. The shoes are then hung from the rafters over a large vat, where steam, time, and the natural yeasts in the porous wood allow droplets of alcoholic liquid to seep through the shoe, and fall into the roiling mixture below. Mixed with rainwater, and served in (usually) cleaned wooden shoes, the resulting beverage is incredibly potent, with a flavor profile that ranges from incredibly profane to lavender, with notes of sweet sap. Gnomes who consume it often do so in celebratory contexts, and in small quantities. Most others experience temporary blindness and an intense hatred for Gnomes."},{"name":"Axegrinder Ale","type":"Dwarvish ale","description":" In the right light, this ale takes on a blood red hue. It gives off a strong scent like a floral meadow covered in dew and tastes slightly sour on the way down with a sweaty finish. Dwarves who consume it often become mildly belligerent and take offense the smallest slights. Most others who consume it experience a noticeable uptick in their spirits (except trolls, they just get angry)."},{"name":"Bitterbeard Ale","type":"Dwarvish ale","description":" This translucent gold ale is topped with a clean white foam and tastes a little pungent and bitter with hints of citrus. Dwarves who consume it tend to brood over hated foes, especially \"the one that got away.\" Non-dwarves who consume it typically experience a pleasant evening followed by a poor night\u0027s sleep."},{"name":"Rockbiter Porter","type":"Dwarvish stout","description":" This dark muddy brown brew is nearly opaque. Its nose is reminiscent of a rich autumn feast and its flavor has notes of creamy roasted toffee and just a hint of mustiness. Dwarves who consume it are often overcome with great confidence in their own physical strength. Non-dwarves who consume it have trouble finishing even a single pint because it makes the stomach feel so full."},{"name":"Nightsky Strongwine","type":"Elvish wine","description":" This deep purple wine is sweet and smooth, and often served after dinner at elvish feasts. In its preparation, the grapes are crushed under an open sky on a clear moonless night to achieve the greatest effects. Elves who consume it are often filled with nostalgia, but other drinkers become very sleepy."},{"name":"Blood Clot","type":"Dwarven Sludge","description":" This bizarre concoction is a favorite among Dwarves looking to make a dare. Thick and red, it contains a congealed glob of fermented goat milk about the size of a golf ball. An acquired taste, it is reminiscent of fortified wine with a strong hint of copper."},{"name":"Demon\u0027s Piss","type":"Dragonfruit Wine","description":" Demon\u0027s Piss is created using fermented dragonfruit and a secret recipe of herbs and spices that varies from town to town. The general flavor is of dragonfruit but often has a backend of licorice, nutmeg, and/or lemon. It is loved more for its flavor than strength, it is only 12 proof."},{"name":"Meadowlark","type":"Human wheat beer","description":" In a world full of 750,000-proof Elven cordials and Dwarven stouts so thick you\u0027d think they were bottled mud, sometimes you just need a good beer. Mild, refreshing, and flavorful, Meadowlark is a beer by humans, for humans, which means that just about every halfling from here to the Drypeak Mountains is drinking it. The noble think it crude, the elves think it unimaginative, the dwarves find it cowardly, but the farmers who drop themselves down at a tavern table at the end of the day wouldn\u0027t have anything else."},{"name":"Frostbomb","type":"Pale ale","description":" The life\u0027s work of a dragonborn brewmaster. Frostbomb is somewhat disconcerting, for a couple of reasons. One, it\u0027s blue. For those who prefer not to consume things that are the color of their cousin Clyde that one time he tried to swallow a carrot whole, that might be a bit of a turn-off. Two, it is absolutely frigid. The steel bottles that it\u0027s shipped in are often coated in a thick rime of frost that must be hacked off before serving, and the cold magic in the brew must be allowed to sit for at least four minutes before it\u0027s warm enough to not be painful going down. All that being said, there isn\u0027t a traveler alive who doesn\u0027t hope to stumble upon a bottle under the counter in a desert bar."},{"name":"Steve\u0027s Mead","type":"Mead","description":" This bottle of mead might have had a label, once, but it appears to have been torn off. In its place, painted directly on the bottle, are the words \"STEVE\u0027S MEAD\" in blocky, crude letters. Clearly, Steve is not around to claim his mead, but in his absence the cork appears to be permanently and irrevocably stuck in the mouth of the bottle."},{"name":"Self-important Prick","type":"Brown ale","description":" The ale inside this bottle isn\u0027t terribly unusual, aside from being harsh and bitter. The true draw is the printing on the bottle, which reads \"Self-Important Prick\" in white letters. Under the lettering is a rendition of a face--a rendition that changes to reflect whoever the drinker dislikes the most at that particular time. There are allegations that drinking the ale results in heightened animosity toward the depicted person, but it might just be a result of reminding them that that person exists in the first place."},{"name":"Fermented Femininity","type":"Semi-magical Wine","description":" A bright pink, cool wine that tastes like a perfect, ripe, sugared grape. That is, it tastes like that if you\u0027re a woman. For men who drink though, it not only tastes like roadkill, but goes down like tar. Rumor is that the grapes used for the wine come from a vineyard that was cursed by a spiteful nature spirit (or goddess, depending on how dramatic the storyteller is) when she found out that the man she pined for was gay. She cursed the man and his lands so that anything he grew would only be able to please women."},{"name":"Sugar Rush Rum","type":"Magical Rum","description":" The Halflings are often unfairly compared to children, but when it comes to their choice of drink, the comparison isn\u0027t totally wrong. Sugar Rush Rum is one of the better examples of that. It\u0027s a golden drink that somehow produces sky blue foam and tastes more like candy than alcohol. In fact, it\u0027s common practice in some areas to put sprinkles in the brew. There are reasons to drink the stuff other than a sweet tooth though. The rum isn\u0027t called Sugar Rush for nothing, as it triggers a mystic rush of energy after drinking it, making the imbiber faster and increasing their reflexes, but making it much harder to focus on anything for more than a few seconds. More than one foolish leader has tried to increase his army\u0027s fighting ability with the drink, and instead ended up with half of his troops simply wandering away before a fight could even begin."},{"name":"Hand Glob","type":"Magical spirit","description":" This spirit was inspired by a mage renowned for his Hand spells, and is magically fermented to create a special magical effect. While it looks and acts like normal liquor, if you pour some out onto your hand, it won\u0027t actually touch your hand but will become a glob that floats above your hand. You can toss it back and forth between your hands, and even hand or toss the glob to another person, which as you can imagine leads to all sorts of bar games and hijinks."},{"name":"Fire Eye Brew","type":"Spirit","description":" Brewed by gnomes using various fungi, this spirit gives the imbiber eyes that glow orange. A couple minutes after drinking a shot, the imbibers eyes start glowing, and the imbiber gains Darkvision for 10 minutes or so. But, while it helps those normally without darkvision navigate the Underdark, the glow stands out as a bright beacon to it\u0027s denizens."},{"name":"Golden Touch","type":"Nonmagical Cider","description":" An almost jet black liquid, this alcohol looks and smells terrible. Made from a strange variety of black berries which grow at the bottom of swamps and bogs, many compare the smell and look to those of something long dead. When imbibed by an undead it tastes very sweet and seems to build till a refreshing aftertaste after a few moments. This has made it a heavy favorite for vampires and the like. Living creatures who taste it describe it as oddly sour but still delicious. Sailors often create this wonderful cider by taking leftover bits of fruit, such as cores and peels, and shoving them into the husk of a peltur fruit to be left out in the sun for several days. Once all the bits and pieces are removed, all that is left is a shiny yellow liquid that has a variety of fruity tastes. One benefit of this drink, other than the inebriation, is that it helps sailor’s combat scurvy. Some starving sailors have compared the taste to the kiss of a lover and common folklore claims that it can help revitalize a man on an empty stomach."},{"name":"Ogre Punch","type":"Thick, sludgy, ale?","description":" No one is really sure what this stuff is, but it\u0027s brewed by Ogres, and can sometimes be found on them while looting their corpses. It\u0027s has a consistency of syrup, and smells like an Ass\u0027s back end, but is one of the strongest brews you will ever find. It\u0027s strong enough for Ogre\u0027s, which means it\u0027s way too strong for anyone else. Just a sip of this stuff is enough to knock even a dwarf on her read end. Although supposedly it is favored by Dragons, due to it\u0027s potency."},{"name":"Tears of Regret","type":"Cursed Magical Ale","description":" The ale is highly sought by unscrupulous bar owners, who then secretly replace a competitors ale with it. It makes the imbiber sad and regretful, as they wallow in the memories of lost loves, family, friends, and opportunities. Even more so than they usually regret those things. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous bar owner makes sure his joint is jumping and happy, with everyone having a good time, and making sure that the patrons at the now sad, depressing bar hear where the fun is happening."},{"name":"Boulderhead Bock","type":"Magical lager","description":" Malty lager with thick and creamy froth. Resistance to bludgeoning, cannot be critically hit. Duration: 1 hour."},{"name":"Whore\u0027s Breakfast","type":"Magical mixer","description":" Shot of pungent clear liquid dropped in any mug of ale. Counteracts one level of exhaustion."},{"name":"Bramble-Sick Brandy","type":"A mistake","description":" Made from thornfruit, drank mostly by Bugbears. Advantage on tracking with smell and hearing for three hours, then Disadvantage for one hour due to sickness."},{"name":"Rusty Cutlass","type":"Hallucinogenic drink","description":" Made with poisonous frogs and honey. The honey counteracts the poison, but leaves the light hallucinogenic nature. The frog is often left in the bottom to be eaten as the finishing blast of effect. Advantage against poison, automatic fail against illusions. Duration: 3 hours."},{"name":"The Drunken Tosser","type":"Dwarven engineering","description":" When drunk, all attacks do an additional 1d6 damage in drunken fervor until hit. On hit, forced use of reaction to projectile vomit at creature who hit you. Vomit does additional 1d10 acid damage. Auto hit if in melee range, range is twenty feet, +2 to hit vs. AC. A miss leaves the five foot square covered in acid that effects any who enter. Lasts d20/2 rounds."},{"name":"Blauzeeg Brew","type":"Human ale","description":" The in-house beer of the Blauzeeg Inn and Tavern, this brew can most readily be obtained on draft in the village of Gelbfar, where it is made. Occasional casks and kegs are sold to barge crews or caravans as an export good of sorts, though the brewing operation is small as such things go. Your basic inoffensive brown ale with a slightly nutty finish."},{"name":"Vackulderbeck","type":"cheap gin","description":" With a not unearned reputation for turpentine-like flavor, Vackulderbeck is popular largely with alcoholics too far gone to have functioning tastebuds."},{"name":"King\u0027s Seal","type":"Nonmagical Drink","description":" Named so due to the molten wax used to make it, mixed with wine, cloves and other flavour-enhancing components, this is favoured as a cool, refreshing beverage for lesser Fire Elementals when it gets so hot even they feel the need to cool off a bit, and very popular with fire Genasi and tieflings, who like to show off how much heat they can handle, the constipation and horrible hangovers be damned."},{"name":"Really, Really, Really Black Rum","type":"Barely-Magical alchohol","description":" A scam beverage used by barkeeps in the seedy parts of major cosmopolitan cities, it is advertised as everything from the blood of demons, to the brew of shadowfell denizens, etc. In reality its just refined 170 proof liquor and capsaicin extract for burn, presdigitated by the barkeep to look black as the night sky. \"Sure, it\u0027s pricey, but if you can handle it, you can add your name to the wall of fame!!!\""},{"name":"Mudwiser","type":"Orcish ale","description":" Brewed in large batches with low quality control standards, other races denounce this popular brand as swill. A perennial favorite in the worst dives and at the gladiator pits with a taste reminiscent of the mudbogs where it was first created. Orcs love it. Drinking boisterously in large quantities, they attribute all their best decisions to its influence."},{"name":"Thadwick Snidwak’s Golden Libation","type":"Magical mead","description":" This sweet, slightly metallic drink goes down smooth and tastes like a million gold. The proprietary recipe is a closely guarded secret of the mad wizard. Rumor has it the drink contains actual gold and will bring great riches to any who partake. But Snidwak was a vindictive bugger who specially brewed this drink to wreak his revenge on the party guests who snubbed him. Most of them still wander his Tower of Sullitude, the now-cool gold shining brightly in the holes burned through their flesh by the molten metal."},{"name":"Tekillya","type":"Hard liquor","description":" Popular among the lizardfolk, this heavy-hitting spirit probably won’t actually kill you. Brewed from fermented cactus and rumbleweed, the secret ingredient is the venom of the tiny Krillworm. Careful, those will kill ya. In traditional lizardfolk taverns, the drink is still served with a random number of live krillworms in the mug."},{"name":"Smoking Dreamkiller","type":"Mixed drink","description":" Not for the fainthearted. This drink packs a wallop. The various ingredients remain separated in layers. The first is harsh and bitter, enticing the drinker to stare into a half-empty mug pondering what might have been. When the second layer is exposed to the atmosphere, it reacts with the air to create the signature smoky mist in the cup, which drinkers swear shows them visions of a heroic destiny about to unfold. The third layer fortifies a man’s spirit to “stand up and do something with your life!” The fourth and final layer goes down in a manly rush, usually accompanied by a belch and slamming the empty mug, still smoking, onto the bar and leaping into action to grab life by the throat. The sudden movement triggers the layers to mix in the drinker’s stomach, almost universally resulting in immediate unconsciousness and a deep, dreamless sleep. The drinker awakes 2d10 hours later, well-rested, forgetting the troubles of the previous night and ready to tackle the humdrum life of feudal servitude."},{"name":"Neverwinter Nightmare","type":"Non-magical spirit","description":" This cheap alcohol is made from fermented chestnuts, which grow plenty in and around Neverwinter. A particularly strong variety is made by a gang of Neverwinter urchins, who hawk their ware on the streets. Some of the more, ah, entrepreneurial urchins will pick your pocket while you try and haggle for a lower price. It\u0027s called a nightmare because there are multiple species of chestnuts, and one of those is not suitable for fermentation. If used anyhow, the resulting spirit will give the drinker a troubled and fitful sleep with vivid nightmares."},{"name":"Elven Feather Wine","type":"Light Elven wine","description":" This light elven wine is said to be made by straining liquid from gooseberries through a special filter made of eagle\u0027s feathers and then fermented in casks hanging from tree branches. Popular with elves because of it\u0027s light airiness, it will actually give any who drink a slight increase to their dexterity and movement speed for approximately an hour."},{"name":"Jester Juice","type":"Mixed Drink","description":" Sold Exclusively at The Jester\u0027s Johnson tavern, this golden beverage smells indistinguishable from a Meadowlark human draft beer. Unfortunately, it tastes like straight unicorn piss. Often purchased as a practical joke on stag nights and 18th birthdays. Has an interesting side-effect that drastically increases labido."},{"name":"Liar\u0027s Brew","type":"Mixed Drink","description":" An exclusive brew at The Liar\u0027s Den tavern, This mysterious, lavender drink is advertised to contain numerous special ingredients, though it tastes suspiciously like Gin and Juice. The effects hit hard and fast. They call it the Liar\u0027s Brew because those under its effects tend to spill more secrets than they mean to."},{"name":"Gray Sludge","type":"Magical Alcoholic \"Drink\"","description":" Gray Sludge is an orcish drink that smells, looks, and tastes foul. No sane man would drink this for pleasure. Shamans make it by fermenting a mixture of miscellaneous organic material, then enchanting it. It is surprisingly filling, if you can force it down. In addition to intoxication, it increases the endurance and strength of the drinker."},{"name":"Kevinsbane","type":"Magical strong spirit","description":" This drink is mostly clear, with a slight bluish tint. It is distilled by a legendarily incompetent wizard, and ensures the drinker will have a very... interesting night. It makes one recklessly confident and greatly impairs judgement, even more than normal alcohol. However, it also gives courage, and ensures that everything you do will either succeed amazingly or fail horribly."},{"name":"Pissin\u0027 Goblin","type":"Ale, Swill","description":" A popular yet terrible ale enjoyed for the simple fact it gets you drunk. With a cloudy blonde colour and taste reminiscent of grass, pine and pepper. Those who drink large quantities are said to develop incontinence and bouts of kleptomania, though that might just be the alcohol."},{"name":"Go Juice","type":"Spirit","description":" A spirit much like vodka brewed from potatoes and a mysterious chile pepper grown in the depths of an insane asylum . The drink is known for its use as a way to pump and excite before a battle, with many drinkers reportedly being run through with a sword and still fight till their buzz wears off. It is also known for the heat and spicy of its flavour. The drink comes in many irregular bottles and containers, but they always have \"GO JUICE\" written in an almost illegible scrawl."},{"name":"Aethernol","type":"Magic Spirit","description":" Refined from a combination of ectoplasm and gelatinous cube remains, this extremely potent liquor has optical properties identical to air. Since pouring a glass of it without spilling is functionally impossible, Aethernol can only be purchased by the bottle. It conveys a limited ability to see into the future, by exactly as much as the intoxication affects your reaction time."},{"name":"Winter\u0027s Tooth","type":"Magical Shot","description":" A light, minty blue shot that stings going down. Instead of a burning sensation, the drinker\u0027s throat feels frozen and icy. Great for hot days. Most individuals find their tongue and throat numb for ten to twenty minutes immediately afterward."},{"name":"Bawler\u0027s Brew","type":"Magical Lager","description":" Most of those who order this drink do so by accident. Most mishear the name and believe it will make them more tenacious in battle and savage in the ring. However, they find that the watery drink they are handed will have them filled with heartache and breaking down into tears halfway through their fight."},{"name":"The Baconater","type":"Magical Ale","description":" Order by large groups of friends or acquaintances, those drinking the Baconater have drunken arguments about who knows people who have met the famous hero \"Kevinior Baconicus\" and how many people they know \"who know a guy\" that have fought alongside him."},{"name":"Ko-brandy","type":"Kobold Spirit","description":" Mostly water. Found in every kobold encampment, this drink is \"brewed\" in a boiling pot filled with twigs and leaves. A few drops of potent poison from the Catstalk Viper are added and left sit for at least a year to break it down into an \"alcohol-like\" substance. It is rarely drunk except by the leaders of kobold camps on special holidays and political meetings. An \"unripe\" batch has a high chance of killing any non-kobold who imbibes it, and does not get them drunk in any way. A kobold who drinks of the Ko-Brandy is much more persuasive, and in rare cases aggressive."},{"name":"Ginger Ale","type":"Nonmagical(?) Ale","description":" Just a normal ginger beer. You\u0027ve always had red hair, right?"},{"name":"Hob-Nobber","type":"Hobgoblin Spirit","description":" Distilled within a natural basin within the cold stone of Weatherwill cave, this murky spirit is a classic among young hobgoblins. Slightly chartreuse, it tastes faintly of lemons and ice until it reaches the belly. POW! A sucker-punch right in the abdomen. Combined with the sweet aftertaste, it\u0027s a perfect blend of pain and pleasure."}]
