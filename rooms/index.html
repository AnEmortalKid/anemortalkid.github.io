<td>The Shrine of the Lost God</td>
<td> On a pedestal there is a a shining golden idol of the Lost God of the Tangledark tribe. A stone staircase leads up to the pedestal. <li>Feature: Around the walls are pictographs using an incomprehensible set of symbols. Along the east wall is a mural that appears to be depicting the apotheosis of a cat-headed being.</li>
 <li>Feature: Sunlight streams green and gold through the shafts in the ceiling, filtering through the overgrown jungle trees.</li>
 <li>Trap: Poisoned darts fly from the east wall when you step on the third, sixth, and ninth steps while climbing toward the idol.</li>
 <li>Trap: If you take the golden idol, a rolling boulder trap triggers from the west wall.</li>
 <li>Monster: A swarm of spiders have made a cozy nest of webs in the northwest corner, near the ceiling.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Burial Chamber of Sir Gordan the Green</td>
<td> Behind the heavy stone slab and down a set of narrow stairs is a small bare chamber with empty wall sconces and a large stone coffin. <li>Feature: The coffin bears the inscription, "Here lies Gordan, Sword of the Realm, Hero of the Battle of West Vale and the Battle of Harstone Pass, b. 1178, d. 1239"</li>
 <li>Monster: Sir Gordan is cursed, he animates as a wight on nights of the new moon. On all other nights, he lies peacefully in his coffin and is indistinguishable from a normal corpse.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Sir Gordan has been buried with a finely-crafted steel longsword with gilding on the guard and a large emerald (2,000 sp) embedded in the pommel.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spruce Spanner's Cogwheel Emporium</td>
<td> Just beyond the plain wooden door lie dozens of rows of tiny, clockwork objects. Clicks and ticks echo throughout the room as toys and other marvels whir to life. <li>Feature: Behind the counter stands a large clockwork golem dressed in fine silk clothing. A black with white trim top hat adorns his head.</li>
 <li>Trap: Near the doors to the stock and equipment rooms are two small metal plates built into the wall. In the center of the plates lie tiny circular keyholes. Should anyone try to force open the door or pick the lock without the proper key, an electric current is rigged to blast from the plates into the intruder.</li>
 <li>Hazard: The clockwork golem, while generally a peaceful servant and helper, will spring to life should the shop be in danger. Hidden under his suit coat are 2 spring loaded hand crossbows that are rigged to propel into his hands at a moment's notice. Behind the counter there's a large maul - far too heavy for ordinary men - should he require it.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Aside from the wondrous toys and gizmos, there's one piece in particular that catches the eye. It's a small butterfly like machination that's been enchanted to fly. Its wings are beautifully inlaid with gold and turquoise.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sphax's Cave of Destiny</td>
<td> Home to a mad, would-be god, this ordinary cave is littered with pebbles and stones. In the center is a plain wooden chair. <li>Feature: The Cave of Destiny is heavily enchanted. Beings who enter the room are immediately thrown the the ceiling as gravity reverses.</li>
 <li>Hazard: Up is down - down is up. When gravity reverses, the once still rocks and pebbles fling upwards to rest on the ceiling. The chair, however, stays put.</li>
 <li>Monster: This room belongs the Sphax, the would-be god of Chaos. He thinks himself mighty, and has the powers to oftentimes prove it, but he seldom resorts to violence. Sphax loves to sit and have a nice chat with anyone he runs across - until they anger him that is. His diminutive gnomish frame should not be mistaken for being frail. Though he may dress like a peasant and sit and talk with newcomers, Spahx is a very dangerous being...when he feels like being one, that is.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Costrin Spawning Pools</td>
<td> Situated in the roots of a massive mangrove, the larva of a primitive jungle race are maturing in the muddy pits dug into the soft ground. <li>Feature: A circular dam of mud and sticks built into the exterior roots holds the surrounding swamp at bay and marks the boundary of the room, but enough water leaks through to keep the whole room muddy.</li>
 <li>Monster: The adult Costrin, in their typical brutality, have trapped a Giant Frog in the room to weed out the weak larvae.</li>
 <li>Hazard: The floor is pockmarked with pits, each about 5 feet deep and 3 feet in diameter. Each has a few hideously squirming Costrin larvae in it, except one which instead has a pupa and the half eaten corpse of a Giant Frog. Step in a pit and you may just lose a foot to the carnivorous larvae.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Each larva has a heavy weight chained to a piercing in its exoskeleton, intended to keep it in the pit until it sheds the shell and becomes a free roaming pupa. The weights are each formed from 10-15 pounds of iron, which may be worth something to a metallurgist.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Modron Factory 7882 - Plating Room</td>
<td> This blisteringly hot room is mostly occupied by a massive automated production line, which in this room applies plating to monodrones. <li>Feature: The room is mostly filled with a straight metal path, with countless modrons marching along it. The path begins in a further on room, and the monodrones continue marching through a hole in the wall into the previous room. Large machine arms work on the modrons.</li>
 <li>Monster: There are several tridrones guarding the assembly line. The monodrones are still awaiting higher programming, but could be a danger if you get in the way of their ceaseless march through the assembly line.</li>
 <li>Hazard: Huge clockwork arms swing around the room, grabbing pieces from piles and adding them to the unplated modrons marching from a hole in the far wall.</li>
 <li>Treasure: The brass, bronze, and silver plates could be immensely valuable.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Chambers of the Robber Queen</td>
<td> Behind a hidden door is a once lavishly furnished sitting room, now fallen to decay. <li>Feature: Tattered silk hangs from the rafters, frayed tapestries line the walls, and the floor is covered in thick, moss-ridden carpet.</li>
 <li>Feature: An opened (and empty) tall cabinet leans drunkenly against the far wall, and a single wooden chair is upright just to the right of the doorway. If there is any other furniture, it has been smashed to kindling.</li>
 <li>Hazard: The floor in the center of the room is rotted through, and may collapse into the room below under the weight of more than one adventurer.</li>
 <li>Trap: Six wicked-looking darts are embedded in the wall opposite the cabinet, but the mechanism that fired them is no longer functional.</li>
 <li>Treasure: The skeletal remains of an unfortunate treasure hunter partially block the doorway, in which can be found a tarnished silver locket (15sp) and a small quantity of gold and silver pieces (2d6 gp, 4d6 sp).</li>
 <li>Feature: Careful study of the wooden chair reveals that it is bolted to the floor. If lifted, the rusted hinge mechanism breaks, and reveals a hidden ladder into the room below.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bat's Mouth</td>
<td> Past a surly bouncer and beyond a sturdier door is a large, smoke-filled chamber. <li>Feature: A massive table - hewn from dark, fine grained wood - fills most of the room, with heavy chairs constructed from brass and stained leather placed at regular intervals around it.</li>
 <li>Feature: Heavy velvet drapes are pulled across large picture windows on the East wall, as well as the area at the back of the room.</li>
 <li>Monster: A Gargoyle perches on a ledge above the door, and will attack anything that doesn't wear a badge of the Brotherhood of the Bat's Mouth.</li>
 <li>Monster: Most evenings, the room will be occupied by 2d4 Commoners and 1d4 Veterans in dark robes.</li>
 <li>Trap: If any of the drapes are moved, 4d4 Swarms of Bats pour into the room.</li>
 <li>Treasure: A locked chest (each Commoner and Veteran has a 10% chance of carrying the key) in the curtained-off area contains gems totalling 300gp in value, 1000 gold pieces, and Wings of Flying</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Displaced Throne</td>
<td> The caves open into an enormous room split in half by a strange line of runes, with natural stone floors and walls abruptly becoming the fine stonework and furnishings of an opulent throne room <li>Feature: At the center of the far wall is a throne backed by an enormous stained glass window, sunlight streaming in. On the throne is a golden crown.</li>
 <li>Feature: Two sets of armor flank the throne. Upon crossing the runic threshold they spring to life and attack the players</li>
 <li>Monster: Two Helmed Horrors are disguised as suits of armor will attack any intruders, chasing them across the runes if need be.</li>
 <li>Treasure: On the throne is a magnificent jeweled crown. This is actually a Helm of Teleportation</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Old Dragons Lair</td>
<td> This enormous cavern resembles a giants furnace, blackened and charred from a heat so intense the stones were left melted and cracked. Scattered across the floor are mounds of metallic slag. <li>Features: Massive mounds of melted gold and steel, the remnants of a dragons horde, create a mixture of difficult and impassible terrain.</li>
 <li>Monsters: Several Thrikeen oversee some domesticated Rust Monsters excavating melted metal slurry.</li>
 <li>Treasure: The rust monsters have eaten into the center of one of the mounds, revealing several gemstones that were protected from the heat by the melted metal shell.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Room of Deafness and Blindness</td>
<td> Entering into the room, the party sees coffins lining the wall. A metal statue on the opposite side of the room glows with a strange light. The statue if of a blind god, and its eyes are covered with a cloth. As the players enter, their vision becomes cloudy and the ambient sounds dwindle into nothingness. <li>Feature: The players are completely blinded and deafened due to the magical aura emanating from the statue.</li>

<td>The Machinist's Door</td>
<td> Entering in the room, the party sees multiple runic inscriptions on the ground, forming multiple circles. On the far end is a door. To its left are 4 small levers. On the ground are several mechanical parts: cogs, springs, sprockets, etc. The parts are ethereal in nature and not of this world. To the right is a wooden ladder leading up to a platform 20 feet into the air. At the top of that platform are 4 consoles, and each console is in a various state of disrepair. <li>Feature: Touching the parts on the ground causes the parts to materialize. Letting go of them causes the parts to vanish and reappear in the pile.</li>
 <li>Feature: To leave the room, the party must repair all 4 consoles, and activate the corresponding levers on the ground. Repairing the machines requires an investigation/tinkering check. The check DC increases from 1 machine to the next.</li>
 <li>Monster: Every 3 rounds, clockwork pests (see Monster A Day Manual /r/monsteraday) for specs) materialize from the runic circles in the ground and attack the party. The number of pests increases by 1 every 3 rounds.</li>
 <li>Feature: The consoles, if repaired, will break down on their own after 12 rounds, unless their corresponding lever has been activated. Broken down consoles have their parts return to the pile below.</li>
 <li>Feature: The levers retract after 1 round and the console self-destructs unless a player is actively holding down the lever.</li>
 <li>Monster: Every time the players fail the repair or the levers return to their starting position, a group of clockwork pests spawns and attacks.</li>

</tr><tr>
<td>The Sparrow Cleric's Refectory</td>
<td> High, slanted windows lets cool, dust-filtered light into a spare room. <li>Feature: A narrow, rectangular table, with benches along its long sides abuts what appears to be a writing desk on its north end. All have been covered in stained linens that may have been white in a past life.</li>
 <li>Feature: Seated at the long table are four crudely shaped clay statues, all dressed in a mishmash of gowns, wimples, cassocks, hijabs, and a host of other religious paraphernalia. Before them are dishes filled with dirty water, dust, and the dessicated remains of a rose bush.</li>
 <li>Feature: Seated at the writing desk is a mummified corpse in raiment crafted from cloth of gold, silk, and precious jewels, posed with wires and sticks in a position of blessing.</li>
 <li>Trap: If disturbed, the corpse (including its clothing) crumbles to dust, and the statues come to life. Each is a Clay Golem, and will not attack unless attacked first. Rather, they move to block the entryway, and will (non-lethally) attempt to prevent all creatures from leaving the room.</li>
 <li>Feature: If the linens are removed from the long table, an inscription is revealed. A player can make a DC18 religion check to read it with the correct pacing and intonation. On a successful check, the golems crumble; on a failure, the golems attack one another, destroying themselves and everything they contain in the process.</li>
 <li>Treasure: The remains of the golems contain 8d12 gp worth of silver and gold-wrought ikons, several minor magical items, and a manual of golems.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hallway of Skulls</td>
<td> A narrow section of a stone hallway with shelves carved into the walls. Seated upon these shelves are skulls of various creatures, some with dried flesh still attached. <li>Trap/Monster Upon reaching the middle of the section, a large skull with gems in it's eye sockets will be seen sitting on one of the shelves. Unfortunately, that means the skull can also see the party. Upon spotting the party, two stone slabs drop on either end of the skull section, as the skulls start swarming around the party members trapped, biting at their flesh. The only way to stop the swarm of biting skulls is to target and destroy the skull with the gems, which is not easy to do as the PCs try to hit one specific skull in a swarm of them, but the vengeful spirit within it is responsible for animating the other skulls.</li>

<td>Caught between a Blob and a Sharp Place</td>
<td> The hallway appears rather ordinary. It's 40 feet long and 15 feet high. The floors and walls are fine stonework. The ceiling is wooden, and well decorated with intricate carvings. The hallway turns 90 degrees at the end and appears to continue on. <li>Trap: At one point in the hallway there are a pair of blades that are triggered by the slightest movement.

<td>Guards of the Brothel of the Lancer's Tilt</td>
<td> (Not quite a dungeon, but it fits the theme based upon my definition) The Lancer's Tilt is a is a very upscale, themed brothel. The sign shows a knight with his lance, positioned in a suggestive manner, poking up the skirt of a maiden. Upstairs is the brothel proper for paying members only. A maître d'hôtel stands behind a desk upstairs and greets clients. Inside the brothel is a band, a bar, bouncers and upscale clientele. The floors are carpeted, there are tapestries, and various colorful suits of armor and weaponry adorn the walls. The workers at the brothel are all dressed thematically, but suggestively: low-cut cuirasses, leather thongs, adventurer's packs, plate metal bras, etc. <li>Feature: The maître d'hôtel has a small runic stone of AntiMagic Field behind the desk he stands at.</li>

<td>The Puzzle of the Star</td>
<td> (I love this room, because it's a fun challenge and positively wicked at the end!) A 20x20 room is simply decorated and unlit, with two noticeable exceptions. On the ground are several sets of runic inscriptions, written in circles. There is a 3 foot long, wooden table in the room. On the table is a small bag, a rolled up scroll and a small golden circle. <li>Trap: Once the players touch the items on the table, the door they came from shuts magically and locks.</li>

Otherwise it's empty.</li>

<td>The isle of Vuraal</td>
<td> This is a round room about fifty feet across with a dome ceiling. Circling the room along the wall is a narrow ledge about a foot wide that is separated from the floor by a two foot gap. The floor itself is a circular disc. <li>Feature: Peering into the gap that separates the floor from the walls reveals a deep pit with hundreds of sharp stalagmites piercing upward.</li>
 <li>Monster: Vuraal, the hooded assassin cloaked in silken robes stands in the center of the room. He is highly skilled, carries sharply honed daggers, and will fight to the death to prevent your passage through his chamber.</li>
 <li>Trap: The floor of this room is a large circular disc balanced precariously on a giant central pivot from below. In order to stand on it safely, weight must be evenly distributed across it's surface. Fighting the assassin should prove immensely difficult.</li>
 <li>Hazard: If the disk tilts far enough that you slide off it's edge, you will land in a pit of spikes.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Passage through this chamber will be your reward.</li>

</tr><tr>
<td>Testing Lab</td>
<td> In a room full of worktables and shelves are various jars with what appear to be liquids in them. <li>Feature: The room contains what appears to be tools similar to alchemical equipment.</li>
 <li>Monster: The liquids in the jars are not liquids, but rather Oozes and Slimes.</li>
 <li>Trap: A scroll tube is locked and chained to one of the desks. Opening said tube causes a shrieking noise to fill the room, possibly shattering any glass objects the party is carrying, and definitely shattering all those jars full of Oozes and Slimes.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Some of the equipment is actually alchemical equipment, and can be used by a PC alchemist or sold.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>A River Runs Through It</td>
<td> This large natural cavern is littered with stalactites and stalagmites but its most notable feature is the underground river that runs through its center. Being 15' wide, it would be difficult to cross if it were not for the wooden bridge that crosses it. On the other side, glaring angrily at you is a small band of hobgoblins with their bows drawn. <li>Feature: A well constructed wooden bridge leads to the other side of the swift river.</li>
 <li>Trap: One of the planks in the bridge is the trigger to a poison gas trap.</li>
 <li>Monster: A band of hobgolins are prepared with their bows to strike.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Boiler Room</td>
<td> A clamorous room whose removable planks hide a still-operating machine. Its purpose is unknown. <li>Feature: A great clamor fills this room, the grinding of gears, the thumping of pistons, and the hiss of steam all mixes into a terrifying cacaphony. You stand no chance of hearing anything that doesn't want to be heard (in 5e language: any creatures in the room have disadvantage on perception rolls relying on hearing.)</li>
 <li>Hazard: Through holes in the aging wooden floor, three sets of huge metal rods rise, whirring and crossing. They seem easily capable of crushing anything unfortunate enough to find itself between them.</li>
 <li>Trap: Stepping on a misplaced board near one of the sets of rods could send you onto the floor below.</li>
 <li>Treasure: Removing the planks reveals the rest of the machine, a massive flywheel spins, controlled by an intricate series of whirling regulators. It is obvious that many could prove quite valuable. If only you could find a way to turn the machine off.</li>
 <li>Trap: One of the more valuable parts happens to be holding the pressure of the boiler in. Those who would try to remove it are likely to get a faceful of hot steam.</li>

</tr><tr>
<td>A Labyrinthian Space</td>
<td> In pitch darkness, walls shift and space bends. <li>Feature: Upon entering the room, your torch goes out, as though affected by the Darkness spell. Moments later, the spell is lifted, but turning around, you find naught but a plain wall.</li>
 Feature: Upon entering the room, your torch goes out, as though affected by the Darkness spell. Moments later, the spell is lifted, but turning around, you find naught but a plain wall. <li>Hazard: Whenever not in view, a wall can shift. It can open into a hall, or make a doorway disappear.</li>
 Hazard: Whenever not in view, a wall can shift. It can open into a hall, or make a doorway disappear. <li>Feature: Leaving the room through any of the doors is unlikely to leave you where you started. Instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the dungeon. Or perhaps many miles away. Its machinations are unknowable, but perhaps not entirely random.</li>

<td>The Black Pool</td>
<td> The room is a round, natural, cavernous space with a tall ceiling. The center of the cavern is separated by an oval filled with black water. On the opposite side is a tunnel, leading deeper into the dungeon. <li>Feature: The walls are too smooth to have formed naturally, and are clean. Suspended just over the "water" and splitting the room in half is a Wall of Force.</li>
 <li>Monster: The black "Water" is actually a black pudding ooze.</li>
 <li>Trap:</li>
 <li>Hazard: Players attempting to cross the water without touching it will strike the Wall of Force and fall right into the ooze.</li>
 <li>Treasure: The ooze's past victim's belongings sit at the bottom of the pit occupied by the ooze, mostly tarnished and beyond recognition or value.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Greenhouse</td>
<td> Likely not to be an expected interior feature, this square room smells of damp earth. It's the temperature of an autumn day, and lit by a tiny sun fixed to the high ceiling. <li>Feature: The room is a self-contained, miniature forest for an agoraphobe, complete with the ability to rain or snow on command. Small trees, bushes, shrubs, and grass fill it, except for the five feet of hardwood that ring the room.</li>
 <li>Monster: None, at first.</li>
 <li>Trap: Several summoning traps fill the room with frogs, insects, animals, and reptiles of varying strength and size. Most leave intruders alone if they're left alone.</li>
 <li>Hazard: Some of the plants are dangerous, and release spores or are just intelligent and ambulatory enough to trip and restrain.</li>
 <li>Treasure: None; animals summoned return to their native planes on death, and any plants removed from the room quickly wither.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Skeleton Cafe</td>
<td> In the midst of an otherwise dangerous dungeon, one finds a door with a sign that says "Skeleton Cafe" and another sign which reads "OPEN". The door knob opens easily and within lies a most unexpected jazz cafe. A small stage has a three piece lounge jazz band. There is a bar with a bartender. Everyone is a friendly skeleton. It's a small cafe, only three tables. Each table has four chairs. There are no customers. It is always open for "business". <li>Feature: Very relaxing atmosphere. If possible, DM should play some light jazz audio at this time.</li>
 <li>Monster: The skeletons are just regular skeletons. They are friendly and the bartender speaks with a slight southern drawl. Bartender introduces himself as "Bone Daddy" and offers the party drinks on the house from a selection of liquors on a shelf behind him. They are genuinely friendly (Neutral Good). If attacked, they will simply panic and plead for their life.</li>
 <li>Trap: None, but the chairs are suspiciously plush and comfortable, and the bartender offers unlimited drinks which are suspiciously free and tasty.</li>
 <li>Hazard: Open bar will feed players drinks until they get shit faced, if they keep asking for more booze.</li>
 <li>Treasure: A safe spot to relax and enjoy a leisurely long rest can be a treasure unto itself.</li>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Button Room</td>
<td> A completely empty, featureless 50 x 50 foot square-shaped room. In the centre of the floor is a pedestal. On the pedestal is a single large red button. On the wall, painted in huge block letters, are the words "DO NOT PUSH" DC 15 perception check will notice an array of 100 small valves across the ceiling (one over each 5' square). <li>Feature: Nothing, really. There is nothing, nothing but the temptation of a single red button..</li>
 <li>Trap: If the button is pushed, a massive gout of fire shoots downward out of the ceiling valves as a reaction. Flames fill the entire room, there is nowhere to go in terms of dodging the 10d6 fire damage. Trap resets each round and can be triggered over and over again if players keep pushing the button.</li>
 <li>Treasure: None.</li>
