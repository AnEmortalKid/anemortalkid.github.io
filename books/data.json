[{"title":"The Arcane Act of Spell Weaving and its Profane works in the History of our Great Empire","author":"Written by Illidan Windwalker, half-elf sorceror and Professor of Magic History at the University of Vinlheim","description":" Here\u0027s one to get us all started: This book was penned by Illidan during his second decade as a Professor of Magic History at the University of Vinlheim. The book has since been published in many copies and can be found in most libraries and book shops. The original still remains in the office of Professor Windwalker, who is working to update it and publish a revised second edition. In the pages of the book, readers may find the foundation of spellcraft, spells and runes lost to History that Illidan recovered, and historical information as to how specific spells have been used in the Empire."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vols. I - VII","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Arthur Serrowen served as High Sage of the College of Elemental Magic for nearly 100 years. Though not a magic-user himself, he held a lifelong fascination with fire magic. By the time of his death, he was considered one of the foremost experts on fire and flame based enchantments and magical creatures. A frequent collaborator in the development of new fire-based spells with wizards of his time, his \"Dissertations\" still provide insights to the modern practitioner. More details on the contents of the individuals texts can be found below."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. I: Wards, Shields, and Protections","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Volume I of the series consists of a detailed explication of all manner of protective magics that involve fire. The pages detail both protections against fire magic as well as those that employ fire in their effect. The author opines that any dedicated student would be wise to master wards against fire before including any offensive tools in their arsenal. Readers of the text often report that their defensive capabilities against fire are improved after careful study of the text."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. II: Sprays, Rays, and Blasts","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Volume II of the series describes a wide array of magical formulae for using fire as an offensive tool. The applications are broadly theoretically and have been praised for their ability to be understood across a wide variety of magical disciplines. The general principles laid out in the text provide an excellent template for the development of new offensive magic. Although a wonderful primer for others, Serrowen\u0027s lack of personal combat experience can sometimes be evident. His proposal for a \"sun burst\" spell, requiring a minimum of one hour of concentration to cast, was especially panned by contemporary critics."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. III: Natural Fire Creatures, Their Habits and Uses","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Serrowen provides a comprehensive overview of all known natural creatures that use, consume, or otherwise live alongside fire as part of their regular existence. A generous grant from a group of druids interested in cataloguing and protecting these creatures enabled the sage to hire an elite group of rangers to explore and document animals across the known world. Praised as one of the finest texts of its kind, it still provides invaluable information about the creatures within its pages."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. IV: Supernatural Fire Creatures, The Magical and Elemental","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Against the advice and better judgement of his peers, Serrowen went to great pains to contact an efreet noble from the City of Brass. Extensive transcription of his interviews with that noble were transformed into the contents of the fourth and fifth volumes. It is largely unknown what Serrowen used to bargain with (or perhaps even compel) the noble to share the information in the text. Many more learned scholars have chosen to disregard both volumes for fear that they might contain incomplete, or even misleading, information. It is unknown whether those fears have any real foundation, as no one has undertaken any comprehensive fact-checking of the work."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. V: The Elemental Plane of Fire, Its Geography and Environs","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Although tainted by the questionable interviews that plagued his fourth volume, Serrowen\u0027s geography of the plane of fire enjoys a slightly better reputation. His insistence on hiring a well respected court painter to record scrying of various features of the plane provide a vivid and colorful impression. Although the specifics of his descriptions are sometimes disputed, conensus tends to suggest that the text and accompanying images are a reasonably accurate presentation of the plane."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. VI: \"Gods\" of Fire and their Servants","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" An unfortunate low point in an otherwise excellent collection. Serrowen was vehemently opposed to any worship of gods claiming dominion over fire. The first few chapters provide a cursory overview of deities with a portfolio that includes fire. He then proceeds to spend much of the remainder of the text elucidating several arguments as to the \"true\" nature of fire and its independence from any divine control. It is unknown why Serrowen argued so passionately against fire gods in this text. Several late contemporaries have suggested that he may not have been the actual author. In a nod to prudence, later editions of the text omit the quotation marks in the title."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. VII: Fire, Life, and Magic","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Believed by many to be Serrowen\u0027s magnum opus, this work combines the best of the High Sage\u0027s understanding of the nature of magical fire with his broad theoretical knowledge of magic itself. In its pages, the author draws parallels between natural fire, magical fire, animating life forces, and the core of magic itself. A dense and difficult text, it nevertheless represents some of the finest scholarship from a lifetime of study in the field. Few claim to have read the volume from cover to cover, but those who have are invariably among the most powerful practitioners of fire magic."},{"title":"Serrowen\u0027s Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Appendix: Enchantments, Instruments, and Artifacts","author":"Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies","description":" Only included as an appendix to later editions, Serrowen\u0027s index of magical items involving fire was tragically incomplete at the time of his death. The text was clearly designed to consist of three sections. The first is a review of common and uncommon magical items using fire. The second is a discussion of a few of the better known magical artifacts using fire. The third is a theoretical treatise on magical frameworks for constructing these items. Rumors suggest that one of Serrowen\u0027s students may have stolen a more complete version of the final text just prior to his death."},{"title":"Interplanar Vortices and Their Interactions with Magical Forces: a Thesis in Three Parts","author":"By Alerio Findelkir, human student at Ulcaster\u0027s School of Wizardry","description":" Alerio Findelkir was a student at Ulcaster School for many decades before it was destroyed by Calishite mages. His book, \"Interplanar Vortices and Their Interactions with Magical Forces: a Thesis in Three Parts,\" was originally intended to be a simple thesis on how portals to other planes can affect the flow of magic in the surrounding area. However, after spending so long researching the subject, Alerio became obsessed with detailing the minutiae of the magical energies, and the project slowly became his life\u0027s work. This book\u0027s three parts are as follows: A small section describing the creation of these portals, a larger section on why they cause minor disturbances in nearby magic, and a long, convoluted dissertation on the minor shifts in magical energy caused by the merging of planes. While most of the text is nigh indecipherable to all but the most specialized of scholars, this work has been spread to many major libraries across Faerûn and is sought after by mages who need extremely accurate information on how arcane abilities can be affected by the intersection of different planes."},{"title":"The Joy of Sects","author":"Dragar Darkstone, human warlock and high priest of the Old Ones","description":" Through his daily four hour meditations, Brownleaf discovered the secret to staying cool under pressure, whether it\u0027s collecting tuition fees from his students or having his adventuring companion being squeezed in a giant\u0027s fist. Brownleaf teaches you how to apply these lessons in your own life, from the battlefield to the boardroom. Found in most ancient temples. Legendary warlock Dargar Darkstone recounts his time in a Cult of the Old Ones, and how it gave the parentless human some much-needed direction, as well as lifelong friendships. A heartwarming tale found in all good bookstores."},{"title":"The Vokhoriad","author":"Anonymous","description":" An epic dwarven poem that originated in oral tradition, passed down through the centuries until it was finally transcribed by a runesmith named Storvi Stonequill. It tells in ponderous, long-winded verse the story of the dwarven citadel Vokhor, which was destroyed by elves near the end of the creation wars. It is a tragic and haunting tale of brave dwarf soldiers led to ruin by a weak king\u0027s folly."},{"title":"On the Maintenence of Necrological Matricies on Skeletal Forms","author":"Written by Alther Gerredon, outlaw wizard, and leader of the failed rebellion of Malduren.","description":" The definite text on the creation and maintenance of basic skeletal undead forms, this text cover Alther\u0027s revolutionary mapping of the web of necrological energies that allow undead to maintain their form and mobility despite the lack of standard kinesiological structures. Ironically, the text is most popular among paladins, rangers and other dedicated hunters of the dead. Gerredon\u0027s work has directly lead to a number of advances in fight against the undead scourge."},{"title":"Grandma\u0027s Recipies","author":"Written by Saffron Grasskeeper","description":" Ooo i like this. A lengthy book about ghosts, spirits and the afterlife. Details many rituals describing resurrection and the maintenance of soul keeping. It\u0027s a fairly populair book amongst Necromancers, although not many of the books exist. This book contain an intricade study of demonoly, both the description of many demons along with their method of summoning. There are stories going around about one page being hidden inside the book, which contain the ritual to summon Arianna herself. Probably just rumors. As the title would suggest, this book is all about surviving in the wild. Which herbs to eat, what mushroom to pluck, and what you can do to help people turned to stone by basilisks. Has a handy cheat sheet where you can look up if the stuff you just ate is going to kill you or not. A rare book about the alchemy of poisons, and a study of poison in the wild. In the back there is a short section about his personal life, and how he endured the many stings and bites he has received. A book describing the strange ongoings in an even stranger tribe. They worship the sun. Are often found raising their arms in the middle of work and shouting \u0027PRAISE\u0027 while staring into the sun. Many of them have gone blind. This book contains an immense amount of knowledge about minerals, gems and crystals. It describes how to properly identify them based on geometry and size, and sometimes taste. usually comes with a small sample embedded into the cover, but cheaper versions simply have a colored piece of paper to replace this. The details of the author remain unknown, and not many copies of this book exist. It describes the act of taming wild animals, and which animals are actually safe to tame. Rumors speak of imbued properties in this book, that whoever reads them will be able to speak to animals. Sloppily written and difficult to understand, this book attempts to teach the reader the basics of Infernal. The useability of this book is long disputed, with many saying it is worth less then the paper it was written on, while others speak religiously of it\u0027s content. Many often blame this on the idea that Asmodeus was in fact a devil himself. William was ordered by his king to handle negotiations between the kingdom and an orc clan. The book details his experiences in setting up a peaceful agreement between both parties. Not long after finishing this book, war broke out between the two and this book was near-instantly discarded. Most dwarfs often consider this the finest in romantic novels made. Other races tend to disagree, the descriptions are very vivid and detailed. Not recommended for the younger public. This book tells of the requirements to become a true wizard; from wands to spellbooks to the iconic pointy hat. Also details possible complications that may arise from being a wizard - like sudden incineration or death by giant monster. As age takes most of us, the need to write down important details becomes imperative. It is to this end, that Saffron wrote a large collection of medicinal salves and healing artifacts for her grandma. In the end the book was cut short due to her grandma dying from a fatal sword to the chest, but this book is still considered prized for it\u0027s healing recipies."},{"title":"Adventurers in the Wild: A Practical Survival Guide for Commoners","author":"By Clement Bosunsmate, tavern owner from Waterdeep and seventeen time unwilling hostage.","description":" This is a book of practical tips for avoiding contact with adventuring parties. From the best techniques for diving into a bale of hay, to making your house or shop look less interesting, this guide aims to aid common folk in the inevitable event they find themselves in proximity to one of the many dangerous companies of adventurers. Of particular note is a section dealing with identifying and disposing of arcane artifacts and how to locate a village least likely to be the site of demonic horrors."},{"title":"On the Minutiae of Romantic and Erotic Emotions: A Study in the Historial and Contemporary Differences in Courtship Tactics of the Academically Inclined, the Sociopolitical Elite and the Illiterate","author":"Harliban Silverbottocks, gnome genealogist at The Grand Athenaeum Historica","description":" An ambitious compendium over courtship, romance, companionships and procreation, of a frankly somewhat disconcerting scope. It includes historical records, mythological innuendos, interview transcripts, peer-reviewed user testings and more, compounding and analyzing all data within and between the different races, cultures and social ranks of the known world. In the 30 pages long foreword, the author reminds any potential interested parties that he welcomes any and all discourse, by letter or appointment. Tied together with the book is its companion book, which further explores the topic of securing potential aid from a third party, such as demonic pacts, a mind-bending Old One or a \"Winged Man\". It also includes the leaflet \"Survival Guide to Succubi\" used as a bookmark."},{"title":"A Treatise on the Uses of Elemental Fire, its Evocations, and Conjurations; A Field Guide for Practical Applications","author":"Written by Aramil \"Cinderhawk\" Näilo, Elder Wizard of Evocation at The Spires: Arcane University of the Kingdom of Eredan","description":" Penned by a retired adventurer-turned-academic, this book discusses many common uses of elemental fire. While perhaps not as thorough, nor as heavily researched and theoretical, this tome stands as a strong resource for the adventuring wizard. The Treatise is broken into four parts: An introduction that discusses basic magical theory of evocation and conjuration. A discussion of the uses and applications of Elemental Fire in Evocation. Guidance on safety precautions and proper techniques of Conjuration involving Elemental Fire. A collection of common spells for the study of Elemental Fire, and application of the ideas disussed in the first three parts."}]
