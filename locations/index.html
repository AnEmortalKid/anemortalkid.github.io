<td>The Common Inn</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> Welcome to the Common Inn. Everything is quite ordinary, you see, there's nothing special about us. In fact, we make a point of it. If you speak anything but Common, we'll kick you out. But don't worry - that rarely happens. Come on in!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aunty Agatha's Apothecary</td>
<td>Creepy building in the woods</td>
<td> There's no one here. So how did we know it was Aunty Agatha's? And what's that's scratching noise - there, hear it? No? It's like it's in my head - very strange. Oh well - I'm sure it's nothing.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Austr'alia</td>
<td>Land of death and Roos</td>
<td> Some sort of time vortex where everyone sleeps when they should be awake, and vice-versa. Full of things that want to kill. Just... kill in general.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shimmerpeak Castle</td>
<td>Castle on a mountain peak</td>
<td> Shimmerpeak stands proud at the tallest peak of a mountain range. It is always summer when you're near the castle. Years after it has been used, it remains pristine and almost glowing. They say that the last king who ruled over it still walks its halls with his wife and kids. They say it because its true. He's very nice, you can go talk to him. Just don't mention orcs.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Feytouched Vale</td>
<td>Large enchanted forest</td>
<td> They say that the barrier between the Feywild and the mortal plane is thin in the forest, and has given the Vale a mind of its own. The Vale is not cruel, any who wish to live and hunt within its borders is welcome to, as long as they are not greedy. You may build lone homes, but attempts to settle towns or build infrastructure are met with mysterious disappearances. The Vale protects itself, mind yourself while you're there.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Zanlamin</td>
<td>Dwarven stronghold</td>
<td> Zanlamin is a dwarven city deep within the mountain that bears the same name. Its namesake was a Goliath hero that saved the city from destruction from an army of orcs alone by defending a passageway into the city for hours, before finally collapsing the pass when he tired, killing himself and all the orcs. His axe, Earthsplitter, was recovered and now rests over the throne of the dwarven king.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mysteries and More</td>
<td>Arcaneum and Trinket shop</td>
<td> Mysteries and More is a store run by a mysterious figure, that few have ever seen. The wonders you can find inside are unlike any others in the world. That's what the company line is. In reality, it is a store with a darkness spell cast on it, where the owner, a shrimpy elf named Taranius used magic to make his voice seem mysterious as he reveals simple items one at a time. He wears a sign on his neck that says "If you can see me, please don't spoil the mystery"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Kadosi Falls</td>
<td>Waterfall vacation destination</td>
<td> Kadosi Falls is a beautiful and idyllic beach and waterfall tucked away in a secluded grove. Beyond its legendary scenery, the falls are a popular vacation point because time seems to go slower while you are there. A simple vacation of a day can seem like weeks to those near it. There are whispered rumors that on rare occasions, the magic doesn't seem to work right and those who enter the grove disappear for months or years, only to suddenly reappear as if they had never left.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sapphire Caves</td>
<td>Wilderness cave system</td>
<td> A small system of caves on the edge of some ocean cliffs. Springs well up from within, and warm, crystal clear water trickles into streams, which empty into the sea. The majority of the caves have been unexplored, though there are constant expeditions within.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>House of Marble</td>
<td>Abandoned home in town</td>
<td> When Mizer Lone, the wealtheist merchant for hundreds of miles, died, his sons sealed his marble home, and hired dozens of guards to patrol the location at all hours of the day.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Luninaria</td>
<td>Lighthouse</td>
<td> A mile off the shore of Port City (insert name here), there is a small rocky island. A dozen years ago, a few druids got together and built a weather station there to monitor sea storms, and a few years later, a lighthouse was built as well. The druids are very picky about who they allow on the the island.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Karten's Bowl</td>
<td>Weird wilderness location</td>
<td> About a mile into a large, mostly unexplored forest, there is a clearing where no vegation grows. In the center of the clearing is a smooth crater, almost a hundred feet across, and perfectly circular. All around the crater are the stone ruins of some ancient, small homes. No one lives here, and the homes don't appear to have been abandoned for any particular reason. Some rangers, led by Fraen Karten, have recently set up camp in the area, and use it as a staging ground to further explore the forest.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sally's Spider Shop</td>
<td>Town shop</td>
<td> Sally sells spiders. Kept in glass cases and jars, Sally has almost all known spider species available. She never harms them, and she always makes sure the buyer is going to take very good care of them, and not use them for any nefarious ends.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Honey Mill</td>
<td>Brewery, bar, taproom</td>
<td> Brothers Jonas and Elias Vaden founded a brewery a dozen years ago. They are known regionally for their famous Vaden Honey Ale. They have recently expanded to include a large taproom and stage, where famous entertainers visit to perform.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Garnack's Greenhouse</td>
<td>Orcish Herbalist</td>
<td> Dis my green house. Not all things green here. Not make much sense. It all pretty. And useful. Can't remember how. I try one. I get sick? I try new one. My little flowers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nimbuss</td>
<td>Monestary</td>
<td> If you travel high enough up the mountains, there is a place were the clouds are so dense that you can walk on them as if they were solid ground. It is here that the monks have built their home, meditating with the wind and conversing with the breeze. News travels most quickly through the wind and the monks have heard it all.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spook Hill</td>
<td>Haunted Hill in a Swamp</td>
<td> Many years ago a gnome village was plagued by raids of a huge alligator. The Chief, a great warrior, killed the gator in a battle that created a small lake. The chief was buried on the north side in a large mound. Travelers to the area report a great sound of thrashing and yells in the middle of the night. Is this the gator seeking revenge, or the chief still trying to protect his land?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Temple of the Lake</td>
<td>Neutral good temple dedicated to the Lady of the Lake</td>
<td> The Temple of the Lake was founded by the lady of the lake who after naming the king of the land desired to maintain a watch to ensure that he and his descendants would stay pure and honest leaders. The core ideals of healing and purity have being passed on through the order now know as the Maidens of the lake who man her temple. They are willing to heal any and all travelers who pass through no matter how nefarious as to judge them would be to make their mind impure, this means that even criminals can seek sanctuary at the temple so their wounds may heal. The temple itself is unique as the entire building is lightly flooded so that every inch of it is a pool a foot deep of pure spring water. This water never gets dirty and is perfectly clear, however someone trying to sneak though the temple will find that it slows them down and makes loud splashing noises no matter how carefully they walk.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bronzburg</td>
<td>Remote village</td>
<td> Nestled in valley between the Copper Hills and the Green Mountains is this quaint village. The site has been occupied for centuries as the hills were mined for their rich deposits of copper, which was sent north to be forged into bronze. When the mines went dry, the valley was largely forgotten; only a handful of families remain, growing vegetables and raising sheep, but hardly enough people to fill the old buildings. Two or three times a year a few travelers come to the village with dry goods and news of the outside world.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Village Square</td>
<td>Small market</td>
<td> An ancient oak tree dominates the grassy square at the center of the village. A handful of market stalls have been set up by farm women, selling turnips, carrots, onions, and cabbages mostly; a young boy is hawks salted mutton and sheep's cheese from a cart; and an old woman offers some crudely woven wool garments. A half dozen people gather at the far end where a peddler from outside the valley is drawing curiosities out of his enormous sack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Shadowwood</td>
<td>Ancient forest</td>
<td> The Shadowwood is a dark and ancient forest, framed by jagged peaks to the east and west and frozen lands to the north. There are legends that an ancient king built a town at its southern edge, hoping to use the wood to fuel his forges, bringing iron out of the mountains. But the forest fought back, swallowing the town whole. Most travelers avoid the Shadowwood: many say only the dead walk among its trees, some say that there are still elves living there who wish to be left alone, and even the bravest of hunters will only venture a short distance in.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>King Cirthoeil's Keep</td>
<td>Woodland fortress</td>
<td> Carved into an enormous rock at the fork where two rivers meet, the wood elf king reigns over the forest from this fortress. Access on three sides is blocked by the rushing waters of the rivers, but vine-camouflaged draw bridges can be let down to allow escape to either bank. The only approach on land ends in a sheer rock wall, the natural formation of rock having been hewn into rough battlements, there is no gate, but ladders can be lowered from the top of the rock. Within, carved stone passages connect the chambers that make up this fully functioning fortress: the great hall, the armory, the kitchens, the residents' quarters.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Steelmoon Academy</td>
<td>Wizarding school</td>
<td> The Steelmoon Academy is located atop a low peak in the foothills of the Great Mountains. It is said to be built upon the site of an ancient monastery of shadow monks who fled the place when a dragon claimed the territory. The inhabitants of the academy are reclusive, and they are led by a mysterious wizard called Gerwac, the Knowing. Admission to the academy is by invitation only, and those who study there rarely return to their hometowns.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Broken Road</td>
<td>Mountain pass</td>
<td> In the Age of Peace, the ancient people of the Western Kingdoms and the Southern States enjoyed a flourishing trade with the Eastern Empire, and that trade went along the Great Road that spanned the continent, snaking through a pass in the Mountains of Thunder. The ancients built several bridges and tunnels along with way-point stations to make the crossing possible, though still treacherous, for carts and wagons. When the Dragon-Emperor of the East tried to cross the mountains with his Army of 100,000 to invade the West, several wizards cast an earth-shattering spell that shook the world—breaking bridges, collapsing tunnels, and causing avalanches—, sending many of the easterners plummeting to their deaths and the rest fleeing for their lives. The place has since been known in the West as the Broken Road.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Enchanting Antique Shoppe</td>
<td>Curiosity shop</td>
<td> Next to a seedy looking tavern on Magpie Lane is a door marked with chipped paint, "The Enchanting Antique Shoppe, D. Obskur, Prop." Down a flight of narrow, winding stairs is a the shop. It is little more than a musty closet with a high ceiling and wooden counter with an open door revealing a room with more shelves beyond. The flickering torchlight reveals all manner of odds and ends on the shelves: lanterns, statuettes, glass vials, glass bottles, spyglasses, unusual brass instruments, fine leather purses, richly embroidered silk pouches, and books of many shapes and sizes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Necromancer's Laboratory</td>
<td>Villain's den</td>
<td> As you open the door with a strange looking mummified eye twitching above it, the heady smell of perservation fluids and decaying flesh rushes out to sting your nostrils. In the room, you first notice a large table containing a corpse. Opposite the table is a desk cluttered with parchment and books. Shelves are packed haphazardly with books, notes, and glass jars holding the preserved remains of all manner of small creatures and organs.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Buried Axe</td>
<td>Dwarvish alehouse</td>
<td> The sign above the place pictures a goblin's head with a large axe-blade buried squarely in its forehead. Inside, the light is dim. A coziness rises in the air from the close-packing of the patrons, the smell of roasted meat, and the heavy scent of drunken dwarves. The walls are decorated with pieces of weaponry, all dwarf-made, and tattered battle flags and banners. The barkeep eyes you as you enter and motions to an empty mug in his hand. "Ale or mead?" he calls out above the chatter and laughter and the clanging of mugs and the scraping of chairs..</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Dog and Pony</td>
<td>Roadside Inn</td>
<td> The wooden structure is sturdy enough, but it feels very old. The soup smells delicious, and several casks of ale are ready to be served. The sign out front touted, "The finest, most extravagant entertainments for all appetites!" However, inside, it's just a dopey looking kid strumming a lute.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Laughing Sheep</td>
<td>City Tavern</td>
<td> The wooden structure rises to a height of three stories. The common room is cozy and tightly packed with tables, a large spit turns a pig in the over-sized fireplace against the left wall. An oak bar stretches the length of the far wall, and to the right is a staircase that leads upstairs. Many of the city guard are crowded about the tables, drinking and eating roasted, and harassing the barmaids, all of whom are attractive, young, and plump.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Storm King's Temple of Winter</td>
<td>Remote Temple Complex</td>
<td> Far to north, on a hill over-looking a cold, wind-swept coastal plane is an enormous temple complex dedicated to the god of storms. With lower levels are built of stone and the upper build of ice, this temple houses one of the great libraries of the world; which has grown over the centuries and never lost a manuscript to a fire. The Brothers and Sisters of the Storm that live, worship, study, and train here include powerful healers and unmatched warriors. They are tolerant of outsiders who treat the place with it's due reverence, but woe to those who would defile it or jest at the power of the Storm.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Xaranth</td>
<td>City</td>
<td> Built around the eggs of Tiamat and Bahamut, the city is concentric, with a clear plan and design to each segment.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Chichester's Tavern</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> This tavern is apprarently perfectly ordinary, until after everyone has gone home, and the barkeep Chitchester pulls on the elk's antler, opening a secret door leading to his underground base, built with the riches from, and to defend against enemies made during his extensive adventuring career.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lair of Kenneth the Slow, Brown Dragon</td>
<td>Lair</td>
<td> Kenneth is a pitifully weak and timid dragon, and his lair reflects this, in the fact that it is a small cave and nothing more. It has a small side-cavern in which he keeps a few bookcases filled with titles such as "Overcoming Anxiety: Public Speaking in Simple Steps" and "Confidence is Key: A Beginner's Guide to Extorting Villages." Other than this, there are no treasures.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Ancient Altar</td>
<td>Altar</td>
<td> Disused and covered in moss, and that couldn't possibly be a pool of blood seemingly fresh upon the slab? Could it? No that would just be insane...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Deep Hatchet</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> Got an issue bubbling up with your neighbour or associate? Don't let it fester, reconnect over a cold brew at the Deep Hatchet, never mind that most guests depart missing a large chunk of their spine, totally unrelated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Poorly Lit Alley</td>
<td>Alleyway</td>
<td> Got some business to attend to? Or perhaps some 'business'? Whatever your needs the poorly lit alley has been known to provide to the most esoteric of requests, but what giveth is soon taken away, weak jugulars be wary.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Trading Ghost</td>
<td>Trading Town</td>
<td> An entire town lies in the mountains, it appears very well maintained with signs from multiple races across the faces of buildings and shops. Only, there's skeletons in the lanes, behind the counters and in the shops, obviously rotted clean from years of exposure. The carts continue to set up of their own accord beside the skeleton near the well, where the bucket goes up and down in an empty well. No sign of magic is apparent, but at night ghostly shapes sleep in their clean beds over skeletons centuries old.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sanctuary</td>
<td>Free Trade City</td>
<td> SANCTUARY! Where anything goes! You're safe here folks, bring your wares, your people, your forbidden magics! Here in the desert no one can hear you scream about all these amazing deals!!!!!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tower O' Power</td>
<td>Mage's Tower</td>
<td> It climbs into the sky, a sign posted at the front says enter at your own risk, make it past the traps to speak to the Mage. The local boys have made a game of trying to get to the top, they say the Mage will grant a wish to whoever makes it. They've only made it to the second floor though, seems like the tower fills with water and flushes em out rather regularly.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Froog's Haven</td>
<td>Farming Village</td>
<td> A simple farming village on the Southern edge of the mountains, east of the River, West of the Forest, North of the Trade routes and a few days from the local Mage's Tower. Watch out for the Town's Elder though, she can talk for hours about the crops, and the goblins, and the time a Giant came through, and the nice lad she met growing up, and the Mage who came through another time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bank of Moradin</td>
<td>Bank</td>
<td> Run by Dwarves, guarded by Constructs and Rune encrusted armor, rumour says that those who dare attempt to steal from it, are never seen again. And shortly after they try screams are heard from below the ground, and a green mist flows from the storm drains, and hooves are heard stomping around them.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Spire</td>
<td>Magical Research Institute/Tourist Center</td>
<td> Welcome to the Spire. First floor: Tourist center, gift shop, food court (Try our magically-generated sausages!). Magical items can be purchased based on availability in the various market stalls. Custom requests can be submitted through the Information Desk. Second Floor and above are not open freely to the general public. Access is only granted through tours or by appointment.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Corantis</td>
<td>City bisected by a river</td>
<td> Each side of this large, sprawling city is dedicated to a different deity. To the west, most people devoutly worship Heironeous. To the east, Hextor reigns. Needless to say, things are rather tense, and the local government is having a somewhat difficult time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sarumat of Nchzzar</td>
<td>Dwarven Kingdom</td>
<td> Many of the dwarven kingdoms of old collapsed millennia ago, pushing many of the stonefolk into a life above ground in the Bothvar hinterlands of the north. One of the few realms to have survived this collapse is Nchzzar, a kingdom whose name means “of Polished Basalt” in the old tongue. Nchzzar is all but totally alien to the surface dwarves that have permitted to visit the underground metropole. Art, philosophy, music, theology, and even politics follow unfamiliar, rigid designs emphasizing linearity and hierarchy. At its head is Sarru Enreddu XXXIV, now in the 312th year of his reign.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Shingles</td>
<td>City Slums</td>
<td> Officially known as the St. Beleth District, the waterfront slums of Thorenbergh have been known colloquially as the Shingles for the better part of a century. As the principle commercial port between Thorenberg and the Antarres, the Shingles have become a hub for the illicit trade of Raklak powder – a highly addictive substance containing traces of lich dust, Drow venom, and obsidian salt. Three gangsters control most criminal activity in the Shingles: Merewen, a half-elf who believes herself a true elf, heads the city’s most proficient cutpurses and padfoots; Grokk Madfinga, a giant orc who receives instructions from Grummsch via his left pinky, who runs the protection rackets; Scarlet Vera, an elderly Tiefling lady believed to be a high-ranking member in the Guild of Rats.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Turnkey Alley</td>
<td>Craftsman District</td>
<td> “Go to Logoria, and find a solid door.” – proverb of the Keepers of Silence. There are no finer doorwrights and locksmiths in the world than those found in Turnkey Alley. One might think the trade one of lesser importance, but with the abundance of thieves, assassins, and generally unpleasant folk in the world, sometimes all one wishes is to have a thick door and a sturdy lock in their threshold. Anything involving doors and their construction can be found in Logoria, including the budding ‘metaphysical doorwrights’ – mages who enchant locks, ward doors, and craft items or scrolls with embedded portal magic.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mount Archos</td>
<td>Semi-Autonomous Region</td>
<td> A thousand shrines and monasteries dedicated to the god Pelor dot the sun-bleached face of Mount Archos. An enclave run by the Order of the Jagged Sun, Mount Archos is a holy site for many of the world’s humans, who tend towards the worship of Pelor. Officially, it is part of the Droghate of Il-Alargol, and pays a hefty church tax to its orcish overlords; despite this, the orcs tend to leave Archos to its own devices, preferring the steady stream of income to raiding along a different mountain pass. Men are generally prohibited from Mount Archos, although male pilgrims wearing a full, black veil are allowed to pray here in the company of a female companion. The monks of the Jagged Sun, all of them women or those who have given up their gender, name, and personhood to Pelor, enforce this rule strictly – visiting swift death upon those who would defy them.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Rhadamanthian Throne</td>
<td>Monolithic Structure // Adjoining valley</td>
<td> Countless bodies in various states of decomposition encircle the Rhadamanthian Throne – a site of important ritual significance to the Thassonic people. It is a solid pillar of dark, polished jade, covered in a dizzying array of historical and religious reliefs and text, extending up nearly 100 meters. The Thassonians believe that the Throne is an extension of their death god, and that by making a pilgrimage and leaving the bodies of the dead here, their loved ones may receive a more lenient judgement of their lives. Whatever the truth of the Throne, two things are evident: the stone from which it was carved extends naturally from beneath the earth, and that it emanates intense necrotic energy. Bodies here decay far more rapidly than normally, and tend to dry out and mummify rather than dry out. Some of the richest can afford to build tombs into the surrounding valley cliffs – most simply pile the bodies at the feet of the Throne wherever there is space.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rainbow Falls Castle</td>
<td>Castle atop a waterfall</td>
<td> Built precariously on a small, magically maintained island at the top of Rainbow Falls, the castle has stood for as long as anyone can remember. Despite being on the edge of a waterfall there has never been a case of someone falling off unintentionally.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lost City of Quartz</td>
<td>an abandoned city constructed of crystal</td>
<td> A city of unknown origins made entirely of high quality quartz hidden away in the mountains of Deanor. Constructed by some long forgotten race, all the proportions are slightly off: doors too tall and thin, steps slightly too deep, and buildings constructed at odd angles. If any quartz is taken from the city limits it quickly fades to ordinary rocks and regrows in the city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Black Fall Mine</td>
<td>Abandoned coal mine</td>
<td> From out of the mouth of this mine a stream as black as pitch runs. No one knows what caused it, what is know that every time an adventuring party enters the river turns red.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Laughing Demon</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, unless you find mounted demon heads fixed in perpetual smiles odd.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Explorer's Rest</td>
<td>Inn and tavern</td>
<td> On the outskirts of the jungle where countless yuan-ti and human empires have fallen is this small wooden building. No one knows when it was built, but everyone knows of it. Any expeditions into the ruins of the jungle go through here first. For many adventurers, this is the last building they see.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>El'Varoth</td>
<td>Eladrin city-state</td>
<td> One of the many city-states the high elves once ruled, this is the only one they still hold. It has no walls, yet none have ever dared to go to war with it. El'Varoth is a continent-wide center for trade, the arts, and technology. The farmlands surrounding the city have a primarily human population, and the city is one of the most diverse on the planet, yet it is ruled over by the powerful fey families, constantly jockeying for power.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Narrows</td>
<td>A Town Divided</td>
<td> Two small farming communities make up the Narrows - though they fall under the same local government heading, they are affectionally called 'Narrows East' and 'Narrows West'. High in the foot hills, the only road to reach the Narrows leads to Narrows West; a massive dividing canyon runs between the two towns, spanned by a handful of bridges running between stone pillar 'islands'. Narrows West is a fairly idyllic farming town; everyone has plenty to eat and drink, warm shelter against the harsh winter, and are generally friendly. The apple orchards surrounding the town are bountiful year-round. Crossing the bridge, the difference is apparent; the Narrows East orchards are hard-pressed by blight and drought, and require constant tending. However, only the women and children work in the fields; the men are all pressed into the town Militia, patrolling the streets. In particular, the makeshift barricades surrounding the small glen of natural stand trees in the middle of town, which seem unnatural lively...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Wonderbringer's Home</td>
<td>Monastery and Temple complex devoted to Gond</td>
<td> One of the less popular deities, not as explosive or sexy as some, but useful and interesting just the same, Gond the Wonderbringer has inspired the worship of many hundreds of thousands, of all races (but particularly gnomes!) over the centuries, and it is here, in this otherwise desolate valley on the Isle of Lantan, that an enormous and populous complex of worship places, workshops, storage caverns, clockwork arenas, and warforged enclaves exists, along with vast, trackless lost catacombs of wonder, and abandoned areas full of mystery and intrigue to defy exploration and classification.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Eternal Forest</td>
<td>An ancient, dark forest</td>
<td> A slowly expanding forest, that can never be destroyed. Trees can be cut down, but new ones appear in their place moments later. A great source of lumber, but not a nice place to be a lumberjack. Some say the trees are alive, others blame it on spiders that live deep in the forest. Whatever it is, no one stays in the forest very long, for fear of their life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Maegor</td>
<td>The City of the Living Dead</td>
<td> A black sun shines darkly in the soot-like skies above the city of the living dead. Inside the sharp, obsidian-lined walls a race of black-eyed beings conduct their business alongside undead servitors of various sizes and stripes. They, too, walk the fine line between life and death. The black sun radiates negative energy down onto the city empowering the undead and, according to some of the more aged carcasses, the dark light keeps the Crawling Cancer from breaking loose and infecting the rest of the daylight world.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Arbold</td>
<td>Small city, heavy trading route</td>
<td> Arbold, near the river of Dase, is either a big town or a small city, depending on who you ask. The University of Arcane Arts has a small campus here due to the proximity to a trade route, where they buy (and sometimes, sell) magic artifacts and exotic ingredients. However, the old Governor is known to be an specieist, and non-humans are harassed by some of the Guards. The citizens usually disagree with his beliefs, but don't expect them to help you.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Delego city</td>
<td>A city up in the north</td>
<td> This city is run by druids, who were so desperate for money, turned to casinos. After the massive success they turned it into a full time business. As a result they have become corrupt, and somehow still maintain their druid powers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Silver Mesa</td>
<td>A city on a mesa top</td>
<td> The best collection of inventors the world has ever seen, 132 years ago was the first convention of Silver Mesa. Every year since the convention has grown larger, to the point that it is now a city.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>GOMA Cleavehide</td>
<td>A ruined castle by the swamp undergoing renovations</td>
<td> The ruins of Alsgoroth, once a proud city, now a pile of rubble filled to the brim with undead. However after an assault from a group of adventurers they now claim it to be their home. They don't tell anyone this, but GOMA stands for Group Of Misfit Adventurers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Junk Palace</td>
<td>A pile of junk that is 3 miles wide</td>
<td> Once the Efreeti told everyone where they could throw their junk, they turned a barren wasteland into a thriving business. Pay to get in and grab as much junk as you can carry from dawn to dusk. If you are not out by the time the gate closes, woe be unto you.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The floating ruins</td>
<td>An island that floats across the sky, and is difficult to find</td>
<td> The ancient city of the gods, floats aimlessly across the clouds. It is said that there is a tree there, that once planted grows solid gold.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shevorth Mansion</td>
<td>A lavish mansion on the edge of the mountains</td>
<td> The inhabitant, a desert elf from the east, is very rich and is interested in the collection of dragon parts. He has furniture covered in the scales of exotic dragons. He is looking to finish his collection of dragons teeth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pelor's Church</td>
<td>A church for the people, on the edge of town</td>
<td> Run by the prophet Zenith, the people love him. He has preached how they will come out of the hard times, and asks for lots of tithing to achieve his gods will.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Misfits inn</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> Any and all are welcome here! You won't even feel out of place because our employees are probably weirder than you! We have our lovely lady dwarf who would love to spit in your food, but can't even see that high. We also have our beloved half-orc Harry, who is striving to be the best barmaid this side of town.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rizgardi Library</td>
<td>A sunken library in the desert</td>

<td>The Shattermap Expanse</td>
<td>Magically Afflicted Geography</td>
<td> A large forested region centered around the capital of an ancient and forgotten world power, whose sudden destruction was enough to shatter both time and space both in the city and throughout the surrounding area. The geography in this region is constantly shifting through space, and often through time. These shifts generally occur imperceptibly, but they become more frequent and more obvious the closer you are to the center, where time has frozen completely around the moment of the cities destruction. Those who enter the city can move perhaps needing protection, but everything around them is frozen and colorless. Armies fill the streets, citizens fleeing and dying. In the castle may lie the source of the disruption, or something worse that spawned from it... All of this is unknown to the modern country who claims the surrounding area. For them, the Shattermap is simply a large and inconvenient mystery, one filled with strange solitary fae and small groups of outcasts and fugitives not worth chasing after. A large road through the forest is maintained using large magical anchor-stones, which absorb and trap magic surges and any fae aggressive enough to try to step onto the road. These stones are discharged (and the emerging fae dispatched) frequently at great risk and expense. Every year the king tries to discontinue this costly maintenance, but the road is used by several powerful merchant families. And so it remains, despite the occasional anchor failure and the accompanying caravans lost into the maw of the forest.</td>

Small dwellings for the sages and elders can be found higher up the tree.</td>

The owner, Sam, sails from location to location and transports passengers for a small fee. It can easily hold a hundred passengers and still have room left for personnel, supplies and entertainment. On-board facilities include a brothel, showers, gambling hall, training room and arena, restaurant and much, much more! The restaurant usually serves some kind of fish.</td>

A first look around when entering this district might confirm that belief, but if you stay for a bit longer and earn the trust of the locals you'll eventually get to the truth. The people living here are actually part of an underground resistance against the local tyrant. Underneath the layers of filth and gruffness one can find friendliness and assistance. This part of town is also home to the black market.</td>

Their sneakily-obtained loot is stored in this warehouse and divided amongst the people later when the time is right. The stolen money is also used to fund food and drink for their members. It has no special features other than blending in with the nearby warehouses and a hidden connection with the sewers.</td>

A few are inhabited by goblin/orc war parties from the nearby region. Giant Spiders also lurk in the darkness of the ravines. Though the path is dangerous, it's the shortest route between two large towns, so many caravans take the risk of the journey then spending days going around.</td>

Built into the bottom of a large crater and long since deserted by the Dwarves when the seemingly rich silver veins beneath the city dried up, it now plays host to everything under the sun. Wary humans mix with cutthroat goblins, territorial Orcs and a few dangerous races from the Underdark. The city's main attraction is that it is an almost direct route down to the depths below, where rare creatures, forgotten secrets and valuable treasures await the daring.</td>

<td>Apothecary Mountain</td>
<td>City and Landmark</td>
<td> When the gnomes settled this towering mountain, they discovered the "screaming spirits" within the first week. Undeterred by the superstitions of other races, they determined that the "spirits" were actually large pockets of natural gasses that were trapped under the mountain. By the second week, they had determined that the gas escaping the natural vents in the mountain was flammable. By the third week, they had set up shop. Turns out, the gas provided a near infinite supply of natural heat, the mountain provided shelter, and the industry of the gnomes provided the clean conditions necessary to harvest and utilize the alchemical ingredients of the surrounding jungle. Thus, the City of Alchemy was born, and it's production inspired the vast trade networks across the southern jungles. The gasses are directed and used to heat massive vats and boiling chambers filled with various bubbling substances both magical and mundane. The entire city is kept well protected, and outsiders rarely see inside. This has led to the propagation of many mysterious rumors about the mixtures and experiments happening inside the mountain, both malicious and benign.</td>

Locked by the rulers of the city for being "unsafe", many a tale is still told amongst the beggar children that if you place your ear up against the door, you can hear the faint sound of giggling children. If the party manages to enter the tower, they discover the interior is decorated all around by stone gargoyles that spout water from their mouths. The sounds of the water hitting the pool at the bottom of the tower echo around the tower causing a distorted sound reminiscent of a giggle. The adventurers must be careful ascending, as the stone stairs are very old and will give way under heavy stress.</td>

In his final campaign, he laid waste to every village he came upon, at one point marching three days out of his way with more than a thousand Orcs to burn a coastal fishing town to the ground. In the end, he was felled by a pitchfork thrown by a desperate peasant in a wheat field, and the lingering nature of his gradual death gave him a level of retrospection he'd rarely been afforded in life. After being raised into undeath by the camp necromancer, he devoted his brief lichdom to reuniting the Orc tribes under a banner of sustainable conquest, leading to a resurgence of the empire of old.</td>

<td>Sunshale</td>
<td>Desert Temple</td>
<td> With deft flicks of their brooms, the lay monks sweep the encroaching desert sand out of the temple, weaving overlapping, ever-expanding concentric circles. Each monk sweeps from sunrise to sunset (or sunset to sunrise), murmuring quiet prayers throughout, pausing only at noon and midnight to take simple meals of rice porridge and steamed fish. Those who aren't sweeping sleep, pray, and participate in a simple bathing ritual in the heart of the temple. Very occasionally, a caravan of pilgrims will visit Sunshale, at which point the monks pause in their ceaseless guardianship, opening the gates that seal the cisterns buried deep beneath the sandstone foundation. The water that flows forth follows the shallow paths worn by generations of sweeping monks, and for an ephemeral moment the name of a forgotten God is carved in stone, only to sublimate in the desert wind a heartbeat later.</td>

<td>The Godslaughter / The God's Laughter</td>
<td>Tavern</td>
<td> Legend tells of a Paladin - stout and faithful - who fell under the spell of strong drink. His God (everyone says it's theirs) chastised him for his excess, and demanded penitence. Drunk on the spirit of the grape, the Paladin forsook his Deity, nailing his holy symbol to the lintel above the door in the alehouse he had taken as his own. From that day onward, the establishment was known as The Godslaughter, a profane challenge to any who would avenge the breaking of the sacred oath. The Paladin (if he ever existed) is long gone, but the holy symbol is supposedly there if you care to look for it. The other legend, told by the smiling woman at the end of the bar, is also of a Paladin. But rather than forsaking his oath, he traded his warhammer and golden raiment for a jug of ale and an apron. Not all souls are saved through glorious acts, she says, or through the business end of a sword. Some simply need a listening ear, a friendly smile, and a bout of honest laughter over a bit of mulled wine.</td>

Just as many brigands, and a rapscallion or two for good measure. But the cargo she ships is honestly obtained, the captain a niece of a family of some small fortune. If you were to ply the seas from Luskan to Baldur's Gate, you'd find a dozen like her. Still, those who book passage in her cramped guests' quarters ask for her by name on the return trip. When the actuaries see her name in insurance ledgers, they give her a favorable rate. The wind blows her way more often than not, and during a storm her canvas may tear, but it's never more than an hour's work to repair it. Some credit her namesake - Wrens are known to be a favorite of Tymora, and even in the depths of winter a mating pair nest in a snarl of rope in the forward rigging.</td>

The fountain is a place of peace and prayer. Upon stepping up to it, you can't help but feel restful. To speak in the presence of the holy waters feels sinful. Pious elves sing soft hymns or whisper prayers, their words blending with the gentle splash of water as it splashes into the Goddess's basin and overflows to the pool below.</td>

During the Fourth Hunting, the old Empire had fallen in such disarray that no warning reached Baldrim's Vale before Westron sellswords and thugs fell upon the hold, putting the town to the torch and slaughtering those attempting to flee.

The residents are all beautiful, young, skilled in the art of love, and well-paid. The girls are taught to read and write, to sing and dance, to play the harp, and to sew. Once a girl reaches the age of twenty-three years, she is given a bag of silver and is turned out to seek her fortune.

The folk of the vale worship Lathander, more in supplication than in gratefulness, I'd thought. Then Maura took me up to the grove. After waking in the middle of the bleedin' night, she urged me on up rock faces near vertical at times. Just before dawn we came to a breakaway near the top of the face. Inside was open to the sky, with a tiny grove of plants and trees surrounding a wide flat bench. I sat with her on the flat stone in among the grasses. She pointed out through the hole we'd crawled through, and as I looked, the sun rose over the pass between the Eastrun range and Gauntrym's dagger. It shone on our faces like the gods' love itself. It would be an hour before sun touched the town below, but for that time, we bathed in the glorious light.</td>

<td>Small Island</td>
<td> "See that tiny dot in the middle of the lake? That's Warden's Hill. And let me tell you how glad I am that it is right there. You see, the borders between the planes are thin in these parts. We've had our fair share of monsters and planar storms run through here throughout the ages. If it wasn't for that tiny island and the Warden's Bell, this town, and every other town at this godsforsaken lake, would be dead as a desert. That's why we send food over every week. I heard they need fifty men and an iron-capped tree trunk just to ring the bloody thing."</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Fountain of Dreams</td>
<td>Forest Fountain</td>
<td> Deep in the Canterbury Woods, lies a mythical fountain that allows for the drinker to delve into their previous lives. The fountain is protected by an elite force of faeries that tempt and test any traveler enticed by the possibility. The calm serenity of the fountain is earned.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Library of the Damned</td>
<td>Great Library full of Undead</td>
<td> A great city fell to barbarian invaders, and while the battle raged, the librarians and staff of one of the worlds best libraries barricaded themselves inside the library in a desperate attempt to prevent the barbarians from destroying the collected knowledge contained within the institution. They had a collection of some of the rarest and most amazing tomes of knowledge and lore. The barbarians noted that the library was barricaded, and decided to set about destroying the rest of the town. They saved the library for last. Using great battering rams, they finally breached the front doors, and were greeted by an army of undead instead of scared library staff. Caught off guard, the barbarians were slaughtered to the last one. The library staff knew that the barbarians would breach the library eventually, and they would be no match for the barbarian horde. So, they paid the ultimate price to protect the library, by using a dark ceremony contained within one of the special books they kept off display and locked away in their vaults, they turned themselves into undead creatures whose sole mission is to protect their precious library. So, the library still stands, it's guardians being unable to be completely destroyed until the library itself is, but the library will not fall while they stand guard, and so they will guard it until the end of time.</td>

<td>The Glittering Mine</td>
<td>Underground mine.</td>
<td> Former mine of the Stonewreath Clan this long abandoned mine stopped being working when the Clan vanished. It is now home to several religious orders and is held to be sacred by almost all. The precious stones are so near the surface that even slight amounts of light make the walls glitter like starlight which inspires the devotion to so many gods. It is large enough to easily accommodate all of them.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frozen Tree Temple</td>
<td>A massive evergreen</td>
<td> Located in the thick ice sheets of the worlds Poles this tree stands undaunted by the cold. Quite warm inside it is seen as sacred ground even by the beasts of the wastes. There was no hollowing out, every seeming structure inside is a natural growth. Plays host to the god of summer, nature and warmth.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lunar Mountain</td>
<td>A small cave system with a hole through to the top of the mountain it lays below</td>
<td> This small system of caves ends in an area with a hole above it, those uninitiated in local lore assume it to be nothing special. However on one night every year, at a specific time, the moon shines through leaving a trail of light to a stone outcropping not unlike an altar. It servers as sacred land to the followers of the Moon Goddess.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Creation Forge</td>
<td>Eldritch Creation hidden somewhere hidden</td>
<td> Long ago, the first Warforged were created here, wielding the powers of the Quori against the Giants. Constructs were imbued with life, sentience, and personality and were given the tools to assist those in need and those in the everlasting war against the Giants.</td>
