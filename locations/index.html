	<td>The Common Inn</td>
	<td>Tavern</td>
	<td> Welcome to the Common Inn. Everything is quite ordinary, you see, there's nothing special about us. In fact, we make a point of it. If you speak anything but Common, we'll kick you out. But don't worry - that rarely happens. Come on in!</td>

<tr>
	<td>Aunty Agatha's Apothecary</td>
	<td>Creepy building in the woods</td>
	<td> There's no one here. So how did we know it was Aunty Agatha's? And what's that's scratching noise - there, hear it? No? It's like it's in my head - very strange. Oh well - I'm sure it's nothing.</td>

<tr>
	<td>Austr'alia</td>
	<td>Land of death and Roos</td>
	<td> Some sort of time vortex where everyone sleeps when they should be awake, and vice-versa. Full of things that want to kill. Just... kill in general.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Shimmerpeak Castle</td>
	<td>Castle on a mountain peak</td>
	<td> Shimmerpeak stands proud at the tallest peak of a mountain range. It is always summer when you're near the castle. Years after it has been used, it remains pristine and almost glowing. They say that the last king who ruled over it still walks its halls with his wife and kids. They say it because its true. He's very nice, you can go talk to him. Just don't mention orcs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Feytouched Vale</td>
	<td>Large enchanted forest</td>
	<td> They say that the barrier between the Feywild and the mortal plane is thin in the forest, and has given the Vale a mind of its own. The Vale is not cruel, any who wish to live and hunt within its borders is welcome to, as long as they are not greedy. You may build lone homes, but attempts to settle towns or build infrastructure are met with mysterious disappearances. The Vale protects itself, mind yourself while you're there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Zanlamin</td>
	<td>Dwarven stronghold</td>
	<td> Zanlamin is a dwarven city deep within the mountain that bears the same name. Its namesake was a Goliath hero that saved the city from destruction from an army of orcs alone by defending a passageway into the city for hours, before finally collapsing the pass when he tired, killing himself and all the orcs. His axe, Earthsplitter, was recovered and now rests over the throne of the dwarven king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Mysteries and More</td>
	<td>Arcaneum and Trinket shop</td>
	<td> Mysteries and More is a store run by a mysterious figure, that few have ever seen. The wonders you can find inside are unlike any others in the world. That's what the company line is. In reality, it is a store with a darkness spell cast on it, where the owner, a shrimpy elf named Taranius used magic to make his voice seem mysterious as he reveals simple items one at a time. He wears a sign on his neck that says "If you can see me, please don't spoil the mystery"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Kadosi Falls</td>
	<td>Waterfall vacation destination</td>
	<td> Kadosi Falls is a beautiful and idyllic beach and waterfall tucked away in a secluded grove. Beyond its legendary scenery, the falls are a popular vacation point because time seems to go slower while you are there. A simple vacation of a day can seem like weeks to those near it. There are whispered rumors that on rare occasions, the magic doesn't seem to work right and those who enter the grove disappear for months or years, only to suddenly reappear as if they had never left.</td>

	<td>Garnack's Greenhouse</td>
	<td>Orcish Herbalist</td>
	<td> Dis my green house. Not all things green here. Not make much sense. It all pretty. And useful. Can't remember how. I try one. I get sick? I try new one. My little flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Nimbuss</td>
	<td>Monestary</td>
	<td> If you travel high enough up the mountains, there is a place were the clouds are so dense that you can walk on them as if they were solid ground. It is here that the monks have built their home, meditating with the wind and conversing with the breeze. News travels most quickly through the wind and the monks have heard it all.</td>

	<td>The Ancient Altar</td>
	<td>Altar</td>
	<td> Disused and covered in moss, and that couldn't possibly be a pool of blood seemingly fresh upon the slab? Could it? No that would just be insane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Deep Hatchet</td>
	<td>Tavern</td>
	<td> Got an issue bubbling up with your neighbour or associate? Don't let it fester, reconnect over a cold brew at the Deep Hatchet, never mind that most guests depart missing a large chunk of their spine, totally unrelated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Poorly Lit Alley</td>
	<td>Alleyway</td>
	<td> Got some business to attend to? Or perhaps some 'business'? Whatever your needs the poorly lit alley has been known to provide to the most esoteric of requests, but what giveth is soon taken away, weak jugulars be wary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Xaranth</td>
	<td>City</td>
	<td> Built around the eggs of Tiamat and Bahamut, the city is concentric, with a clear plan and design to each segment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Chichester's Tavern</td>
	<td>Tavern</td>
	<td> This tavern is apprarently perfectly ordinary, until after everyone has gone home, and the barkeep Chitchester pulls on the elk's antler, opening a secret door leading to his underground base, built with the riches from, and to defend against enemies made during his extensive adventuring career.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Trading Ghost</td>
	<td>Trading Town</td>
	<td> An entire town lies in the mountains, it appears very well maintained with signs from multiple races across the faces of buildings and shops. Only, there's skeletons in the lanes, behind the counters and in the shops, obviously rotted clean from years of exposure. The carts continue to set up of their own accord beside the skeleton near the well, where the bucket goes up and down in an empty well. No sign of magic is apparent, but at night ghostly shapes sleep in their clean beds over skeletons centuries old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Sanctuary</td>
	<td>Free Trade City</td>
	<td> SANCTUARY! Where anything goes! You're safe here folks, bring your wares, your people, your forbidden magics! Here in the desert no one can hear you scream about all these amazing deals!!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Tower O' Power</td>
	<td>Mage's Tower</td>
	<td> It climbs into the sky, a sign posted at the front says enter at your own risk, make it past the traps to speak to the Mage. The local boys have made a game of trying to get to the top, they say the Mage will grant a wish to whoever makes it. They've only made it to the second floor though, seems like the tower fills with water and flushes em out rather regularly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Froog's Haven</td>
	<td>Farming Village</td>
	<td> A simple farming village on the Southern edge of the mountains, east of the River, West of the Forest, North of the Trade routes and a few days from the local Mage's Tower. Watch out for the Town's Elder though, she can talk for hours about the crops, and the goblins, and the time a Giant came through, and the nice lad she met growing up, and the Mage who came through another time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Bank of Moradin</td>
	<td>Bank</td>
	<td> Run by Dwarves, guarded by Constructs and Rune encrusted armor, rumour says that those who dare attempt to steal from it, are never seen again. And shortly after they try screams are heard from below the ground, and a green mist flows from the storm drains, and hooves are heard stomping around them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Spire</td>
	<td>Magical Research Institute/Tourist Center</td>
	<td> Welcome to the Spire. First floor: Tourist center, gift shop, food court (Try our magically-generated sausages!). Magical items can be purchased based on availability in the various market stalls. Custom requests can be submitted through the Information Desk. Second Floor and above are not open freely to the general public. Access is only granted through tours or by appointment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Corantis</td>
	<td>City bisected by a river</td>
	<td> Each side of this large, sprawling city is dedicated to a different deity. To the west, most people devoutly worship Heironeous. To the east, Hextor reigns. Needless to say, things are rather tense, and the local government is having a somewhat difficult time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Sarumat of Nchzzar</td>
	<td>Dwarven Kingdom</td>
	<td> Many of the dwarven kingdoms of old collapsed millennia ago, pushing many of the stonefolk into a life above ground in the Bothvar hinterlands of the north. One of the few realms to have survived this collapse is Nchzzar, a kingdom whose name means “of Polished Basalt” in the old tongue. Nchzzar is all but totally alien to the surface dwarves that have permitted to visit the underground metropole. Art, philosophy, music, theology, and even politics follow unfamiliar, rigid designs emphasizing linearity and hierarchy. At its head is Sarru Enreddu XXXIV, now in the 312th year of his reign.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Shingles</td>
	<td>City Slums</td>
	<td> Officially known as the St. Beleth District, the waterfront slums of Thorenbergh have been known colloquially as the Shingles for the better part of a century. As the principle commercial port between Thorenberg and the Antarres, the Shingles have become a hub for the illicit trade of Raklak powder – a highly addictive substance containing traces of lich dust, Drow venom, and obsidian salt. Three gangsters control most criminal activity in the Shingles: Merewen, a half-elf who believes herself a true elf, heads the city’s most proficient cutpurses and padfoots; Grokk Madfinga, a giant orc who receives instructions from Grummsch via his left pinky, who runs the protection rackets; Scarlet Vera, an elderly Tiefling lady believed to be a high-ranking member in the Guild of Rats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Turnkey Alley</td>
	<td>Craftsman District</td>
	<td> “Go to Logoria, and find a solid door.” – proverb of the Keepers of Silence. There are no finer doorwrights and locksmiths in the world than those found in Turnkey Alley. One might think the trade one of lesser importance, but with the abundance of thieves, assassins, and generally unpleasant folk in the world, sometimes all one wishes is to have a thick door and a sturdy lock in their threshold. Anything involving doors and their construction can be found in Logoria, including the budding ‘metaphysical doorwrights’ – mages who enchant locks, ward doors, and craft items or scrolls with embedded portal magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Mount Archos</td>
	<td>Semi-Autonomous Region</td>
	<td> A thousand shrines and monasteries dedicated to the god Pelor dot the sun-bleached face of Mount Archos. An enclave run by the Order of the Jagged Sun, Mount Archos is a holy site for many of the world’s humans, who tend towards the worship of Pelor. Officially, it is part of the Droghate of Il-Alargol, and pays a hefty church tax to its orcish overlords; despite this, the orcs tend to leave Archos to its own devices, preferring the steady stream of income to raiding along a different mountain pass. Men are generally prohibited from Mount Archos, although male pilgrims wearing a full, black veil are allowed to pray here in the company of a female companion. The monks of the Jagged Sun, all of them women or those who have given up their gender, name, and personhood to Pelor, enforce this rule strictly – visiting swift death upon those who would defy them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Rhadamanthian Throne</td>
	<td>Monolithic Structure // Adjoining valley</td>
	<td> Countless bodies in various states of decomposition encircle the Rhadamanthian Throne – a site of important ritual significance to the Thassonic people. It is a solid pillar of dark, polished jade, covered in a dizzying array of historical and religious reliefs and text, extending up nearly 100 meters. The Thassonians believe that the Throne is an extension of their death god, and that by making a pilgrimage and leaving the bodies of the dead here, their loved ones may receive a more lenient judgement of their lives. Whatever the truth of the Throne, two things are evident: the stone from which it was carved extends naturally from beneath the earth, and that it emanates intense necrotic energy. Bodies here decay far more rapidly than normally, and tend to dry out and mummify rather than dry out. Some of the richest can afford to build tombs into the surrounding valley cliffs – most simply pile the bodies at the feet of the Throne wherever there is space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Rainbow Falls Castle</td>
	<td>Castle atop a waterfall</td>
	<td> Built precariously on a small, magically maintained island at the top of Rainbow Falls, the castle has stood for as long as anyone can remember. Despite being on the edge of a waterfall there has never been a case of someone falling off unintentionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Black Fall Mine</td>
	<td>Abandoned coal mine</td>
	<td> From out of the mouth of this mine a stream as black as pitch runs. No one knows what caused it, what is know that every time an adventuring party enters the river turns red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Laughing Demon</td>
	<td>Tavern</td>
	<td> Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, unless you find mounted demon heads fixed in perpetual smiles odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Explorer's Rest</td>
	<td>Inn and tavern</td>
	<td> On the outskirts of the jungle where countless yuan-ti and human empires have fallen is this small wooden building. No one knows when it was built, but everyone knows of it. Any expeditions into the ruins of the jungle go through here first. For many adventurers, this is the last building they see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>El'Varoth</td>
	<td>Eladrin city-state</td>
	<td> One of the many city-states the high elves once ruled, this is the only one they still hold. It has no walls, yet none have ever dared to go to war with it. El'Varoth is a continent-wide center for trade, the arts, and technology. The farmlands surrounding the city have a primarily human population, and the city is one of the most diverse on the planet, yet it is ruled over by the powerful fey families, constantly jockeying for power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Sapphire Caves</td>
	<td>Wilderness cave system</td>
	<td> A small system of caves on the edge of some ocean cliffs. Springs well up from within, and warm, crystal clear water trickles into streams, which empty into the sea. The majority of the caves have been unexplored, though there are constant expeditions within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>House of Marble</td>
	<td>Abandoned home in town</td>
	<td> When Mizer Lone, the wealtheist merchant for hundreds of miles, died, his sons sealed his marble home, and hired dozens of guards to patrol the location at all hours of the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Luninaria</td>
	<td>Lighthouse</td>
	<td> A mile off the shore of Port City (insert name here), there is a small rocky island. A dozen years ago, a few druids got together and built a weather station there to monitor sea storms, and a few years later, a lighthouse was built as well. The druids are very picky about who they allow on the the island.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Karten's Bowl</td>
	<td>Weird wilderness location</td>
	<td> About a mile into a large, mostly unexplored forest, there is a clearing where no vegation grows. In the center of the clearing is a smooth crater, almost a hundred feet across, and perfectly circular. All around the crater are the stone ruins of some ancient, small homes. No one lives here, and the homes don't appear to have been abandoned for any particular reason. Some rangers, led by Fraen Karten, have recently set up camp in the area, and use it as a staging ground to further explore the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Sally's Spider Shop</td>
	<td>Town shop</td>
	<td> Sally sells spiders. Kept in glass cases and jars, Sally has almost all known spider species available. She never harms them, and she always makes sure the buyer is going to take very good care of them, and not use them for any nefarious ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Honey Mill</td>
	<td>Brewery, bar, taproom</td>
	<td> Brothers Jonas and Elias Vaden founded a brewery a dozen years ago. They are known regionally for their famous Vaden Honey Ale. They have recently expanded to include a large taproom and stage, where famous entertainers visit to perform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Spook Hill</td>
	<td>Haunted Hill in a Swamp</td>
	<td> Many years ago a gnome village was plagued by raids of a huge alligator. The Chief, a great warrior, killed the gator in a battle that created a small lake. The chief was buried on the north side in a large mound. Travelers to the area report a great sound of thrashing and yells in the middle of the night. Is this the gator seeking revenge, or the chief still trying to protect his land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Temple of the Lake</td>
	<td>Neutral good temple dedicated to the Lady of the Lake</td>
	<td> The Temple of the Lake was founded by the lady of the lake who after naming the king of the land desired to maintain a watch to ensure that he and his descendants would stay pure and honest leaders. The core ideals of healing and purity have being passed on through the order now know as the Maidens of the lake who man her temple. They are willing to heal any and all travelers who pass through no matter how nefarious as to judge them would be to make their mind impure, this means that even criminals can seek sanctuary at the temple so their wounds may heal. The temple itself is unique as the entire building is lightly flooded so that every inch of it is a pool a foot deep of pure spring water. This water never gets dirty and is perfectly clear, however someone trying to sneak though the temple will find that it slows them down and makes loud splashing noises no matter how carefully they walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Bronzburg</td>
	<td>Remote village</td>
	<td> Nestled in valley between the Copper Hills and the Green Mountains is this quaint village. The site has been occupied for centuries as the hills were mined for their rich deposits of copper, which was sent north to be forged into bronze. When the mines went dry, the valley was largely forgotten; only a handful of families remain, growing vegetables and raising sheep, but hardly enough people to fill the old buildings. Two or three times a year a few travelers come to the village with dry goods and news of the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Shadowwood</td>
	<td>Ancient forest</td>
	<td> The Shadowwood is a dark and ancient forest, framed by jagged peaks to the east and west and frozen lands to the north. There are legends that an ancient king built a town at its southern edge, hoping to use the wood to fuel his forges, bringing iron out of the mountains. But the forest fought back, swallowing the town whole. Most travelers avoid the Shadowwood: many say only the dead walk among its trees, some say that there are still elves living there who wish to be left alone, and even the bravest of hunters will only venture a short distance in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Steelmoon Academy</td>
	<td>Wizarding school</td>
	<td> The Steelmoon Academy is located atop a low peak in the foothills of the Great Mountains. It is said to be built upon the site of an ancient monastery of shadow monks who fled the place when a dragon claimed the territory. The inhabitants of the academy are reclusive, and they are led by a mysterious wizard called Gerwac, the Knowing. Admission to the academy is by invitation only, and those who study there rarely return to their hometowns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Broken Road</td>
	<td>Mountain pass</td>
	<td> In the Age of Peace, the ancient people of the Western Kingdoms and the Southern States enjoyed a flourishing trade with the Eastern Empire, and that trade went along the Great Road that spanned the continent, snaking through a pass in the Mountains of Thunder. The ancients built several bridges and tunnels along with way-point stations to make the crossing possible, though still treacherous, for carts and wagons. When the Dragon-Emperor of the East tried to cross the mountains with his Army of 100,000 to invade the West, several wizards cast an earth-shattering spell that shook the world—breaking bridges, collapsing tunnels, and causing avalanches—, sending many of the easterners plummeting to their deaths and the rest fleeing for their lives. The place has since been known in the West as the Broken Road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Enchanting Antique Shoppe</td>
	<td>Curiosity shop</td>
	<td> Next to a seedy looking tavern on Magpie Lane is a door marked with chipped paint, "The Enchanting Antique Shoppe, D. Obskur, Prop." Down a flight of narrow, winding stairs is a the shop. It is little more than a musty closet with a high ceiling and wooden counter with an open door revealing a room with more shelves beyond. The flickering torchlight reveals all manner of odds and ends on the shelves: lanterns, statuettes, glass vials, glass bottles, spyglasses, unusual brass instruments, fine leather purses, richly embroidered silk pouches, and books of many shapes and sizes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The Narrows</td>
	<td>A Town Divided</td>
	<td> Two small farming communities make up the Narrows - though they fall under the same local government heading, they are affectionally called 'Narrows East' and 'Narrows West'. High in the foot hills, the only road to reach the Narrows leads to Narrows West; a massive dividing canyon runs between the two towns, spanned by a handful of bridges running between stone pillar 'islands'. Narrows West is a fairly idyllic farming town; everyone has plenty to eat and drink, warm shelter against the harsh winter, and are generally friendly. The apple orchards surrounding the town are bountiful year-round. Crossing the bridge, the difference is apparent; the Narrows East orchards are hard-pressed by blight and drought, and require constant tending. However, only the women and children work in the fields; the men are all pressed into the town Militia, patrolling the streets. In particular, the makeshift barricades surrounding the small glen of natural stand trees in the middle of town, which seem unnatural lively...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Wonderbringer's Home</td>
	<td>Monastery and Temple complex devoted to Gond</td>
	<td> One of the less popular deities, not as explosive or sexy as some, but useful and interesting just the same, Gond the Wonderbringer has inspired the worship of many hundreds of thousands over the centuries, and it is here, in this otherwise desolate valley on the Isle of Lantan, that an enormous and populous complex of worship places, workshops, storage caverns, clockwork arenas, and warforged enclaves exists, along with vast, trackless lost catacombs of wonder, and abandoned areas full of mystery and intrigue to defy exploration and classification.</td>
