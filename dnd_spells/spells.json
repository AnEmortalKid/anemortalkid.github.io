Within the sphere, spells can\u2019t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the spere moves with you, centered on you. \nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. \n\nTargeted Effects. \nSpells and other magical effects, such as magic missle and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. \n\nAreas of Magic. \nThe area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. \n\nSpells. \n\u00a0Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. \n\nMagic Items. \nThe properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. Forexample, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be supressed as soon as it exits. \n\nMagical Travel. \nTeleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere. \n\nCreatures and Objects. \nA creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer withinthe sphere. \n\nDispel Magic. \nSpells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don\u2019t nullify each other.",

When the spell ends,\u00a0the affected creature returns to its physical body,\u00a0and it awakens.\u00a0\n\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your\u00a0companions. A successful dispel magic spell used\u00a0against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that\u00a0creature. If a creature\u2019s original body or its astral form\u00a0drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If\u00a0the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls\u00a0the creature\u2019s astral form back to its body, ending its\u00a0state of suspended animation.\u00a0If you are returned to your body prematurely, your\u00a0companions remain in their astral forms and must find\u00a0their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping\u00a0to 0 hit points.",

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave\u2019s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. \n\nPart Water \nYou cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell\u2019s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. \n\nRedirect Flow\u00a0\nYou cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell\u2019s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. \n\nWhirlpool\u00a0\nThis effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. \nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn\u2019t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. \nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage,\u00a0this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

Creatures that don\u2019t sleep, such as elves, can\u2019t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can\u2019t take actions or move. \n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target\u2019s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target\u2019s dreams. \n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target\u2019s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. \n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target\u2019s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.",

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.

    "description": "You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.\n\nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\n\nCorridors\nFog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\n\nDoors\nAll doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the m inor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.\n\nStairs\nWebs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\n\nOther Spell Effect\nYou can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\n\u2022 Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate\u00a0a simple program that the lights repeat as long as\nguards and wards lasts.\n\u2022 Place magic mouth in two locations.\n\u2022 Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors\u00a0appear in the places you designate; they return within\u00a010 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and\u00a0wards lasts.\n\u2022 Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.\n\u2022 Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area\u00a0of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters\nor passes through the area receives the suggestion\u00a0mentally.\n\nThe whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel\u00a0magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes\u00a0only that effect.\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded\u00a0structure by casting this spell there every day\u00a0for one year.",

Light can pass through the gemstone normally\u00a0(allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see\u00a0in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of\u00a0teleportation or planar travel.

The\u00a0condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you\u00a0choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is\u00a0reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The\u00a0conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity,\u00a0or deity but otherwise must be based on observable\u00a0actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as\u00a0level, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast\u00a0as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the\u00a0special component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create\u00a0only one prison at a time.

When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall\u2019s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer\u2019s properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n\n1. Red.

While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can\u2019t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n\n3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\n4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\n5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\n6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u2019t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can\u2019t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\n7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM\u2019s choosing and is no longer blinded.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\nOn Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\nOff Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area\nYou and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap\nThe spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\u2019s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can\u2019t occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn\u2019t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM\u2019s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can\u2019t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don\u2019t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n\u2022 You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n\u2022 You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your com panions immune to a lich\u2019s life drain attack.\n\n\u2022 You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire mightonlybepartlyachieved,oryoumightsuffersome unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",
