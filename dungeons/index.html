<tbody><tr>
<td>Hole in the Hills</td>
<td>Abandoned mine</td>
<td> This abandoned copper mine has recently been occupied by a band of displaced and hungry goblins. These goblins have been making raids against the local sheepherders. They carry off sheep because the sheep don't seem to fight back as much as the sheepherders do.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hilltop Ruins</td>
<td>Castle ruin</td>
<td> This ancient ruin would have held a commanding view of the valley. The place is so old that no one really knows who built it. Despite it's lack of known history, there seems to be a new and unpleasant denizen living in the cellars and dungeons of the ruin every week.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Filth Outside, the City's Refuse</td>
<td>Urban rubbish heap</td>
<td> Outside the city's walls, a half mile downriver atop a low-lying marsh is the city's main rubbish heap. The place is a swamp, a cesspool, and a labyrinth of stacked garbage. It is a den for scavengers and a treasure trove for beggars. Several kobold tribes, more than one type of carrion-eater, and a vicious gang of beggar-thieves (led by a wererat named Oskher) have made themselves at home among the moist mess that the city belches forth daily. Barges carry the trash downriver to a crude landing and then filthy lugs cart the trash from the landing to fill in whatever open spot is convenient.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Filth Below, the City Sewers</td>
<td>City sewers</td>
<td> Below the city streets are the narrow sewers that carry run-off and other filth to the river. The newer portions of the sewers are connected by tunnels barely large enough for a child, but the older pipes are tall enough and wide enough for grown men to walk upright, wading through the filth. Once a year, the city sweeps out the rats, oozes, toxic fish, and other filthy critters. Occasionally they find something truly dangerous has taken up residence in the filth below.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Thunderdome</td>
<td>Prison/arena on a floating earth mote</td>
<td> "Welcome! All who come here will die!" Nestor, Lord of the Cloud Giants greets you. This is where he releases his prisoners into an enormous central cavern in the lowest levels of his flying mountain fortress. Several galleries for spectators, often including Nestor himself, are perched high on the walls. Prisoners begin in the central cavern, but most run for one of the exit tunnels to avoid the pair of nearly-blind ancient white dragons chained within it. In the tunnels are a variety of hungry beasts and restless dead. If you are fortunate enough not to become something's meal, there is a good change that a wrong step will send you sliding down a chute that opens up into the sky beneath the fortress.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>King Cirthoeil's Dungeon</td>
<td>Underground prison</td>
<td> Carved into an enormous rock at the fork where two rivers meet, the wood elf king reigns over the forest from this fortress. He keeps his prisoners in the damp lower levels. At times when the rivers rise, the hewn-stone chambers flood. The passages twist and rise and fall in a confusing pattern, making escape difficult. Even if you make it past the guards, you will need to manage to sneak out over one of the two main drawbridges to escape.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bone Crypt</td>
<td>Monastery ruin/crypt</td>
<td> Beneath the ruins of the shadow monks' monastery are many crypts, but none like this. The written accounts have been lost, but legends hold that a powerful shadow-brother demanded this crypt be built as a monument to honor death itself. The crypt is small, only a few rooms, but every inch of the walls and ceilings are covered in intricately assembled designs made of humanoid bones. Fully assembled skeletons are mounted to the walls and ceilings and swirling patterns of bone cover the spaces in between. The locals fear the monastery, but they shudder at the mention of the Bone Crypt.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Crypt of Death's Kiss</td>
<td>Temple complex/crypt</td>
<td> The temple complex dedicated to the sun god has been here for over a thousand years, but worshipers of the sun god have only been here for a few centuries. Parts of the original temple are still intact in the lower levels, a temple dedicated to a long-forgotten the goddess of death. Her servants lie waiting for her return, waiting for the light of the sun god to burn out.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Ruined City of Cherunalem</td>
<td>Ancient ruin</td>
<td> This was once a thriving town of brick and stone buildings and paved stone streets. Centuries ago, a nearby volcano underwent a massive eruption that sent lava flows down against the walls and that engulfed the town and its residents in a cloud of burning hot ash. Now it is remembered in song, and any who visit will find a strange ghostly reminder of its former vibrancy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Caverns of Flamesong Mountain</td>
<td>Active Volcano</td>
<td> Flamesong Mountain towers above the plane around it, quietly waiting to unleash its fury—as it did at least once before, long in the past. In living memory, it does little more than occasionally belch a small puff of ash a few times a year. Within the mountain, are twisting, inter-connected tunnels left by rapid lava flows of more violent eruptions. The air in the tunnels is hot and stinks of sulfur. Stories speak of red dragons, fire giants, and efreet living below Flamesong, but these may be nothing more than stories.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frozen Caverns of Gr'guth</td>
<td>Ice caves</td>
<td> Below the mountains, far to the north, Gr'guth the Mighty Frost Giant King holds court. Gr'gurth's court is a pretty dull place, since there are rarely visitors in his cold and inhospitable realm. He leaves the front door unguarded and waits impatiently for guests to arrive for dinner. If you can't find your way through the mazes of tunnels to meet your host, you needn't worry: his wolves will find you.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Vaults of the Temple of Winter</td>
<td>Hidden Temple Chambers and Treasury</td>
<td> Beneath the Storm King's Temple of Winter is a network of chambers and passages, the existence of which is well known to those outside the temple. However, only the Brothers and Sisters of Storms that reside in the temple complex are allowed into the lower levels, so rumors of what lies within vary wildly. Some say that within these halls of ice and stone is an older, more heavily-guarded library than the famed library in the upper levels. Within the library are books containing spells of terrible power and horrifying secrets of the cosmos. Whispers also speak of foul creatures, preserved in ice, kept for study and observation by the temple's scholars—demons, devils, dragons, and things even older and fouler.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Sitadel</td>
<td>Primary stronghold in the Puppy Realm</td>
<td> This world is an unending sea of puppies rising and falling like turbulent waves in an ocean. The Sitadel is made of compact and shaped puppies and holds their most valued and malicious of the PUPulation. High up in the Sitadel's towers reigns the most powerful illusionist puppy in the realm Booo, forever looking like the cutest stuffed animal puppy. In contrast, down below in the darkest dungeons resides the most mangy lot imanginable, the Pound Puppies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sacred Sky Burial of the Elves</td>
<td>A heavily trapped tower</td>
<td> The elves have long buried their most glorious dead on top of or within their Sacred Sky Tower. They bury them with their most precious items, armor, and weapons. This temps would-be grave robbers and adventurers and thus the elves have made each level leading up to the tower a labyrinth of puzzles and traps. What most don't know is that there is an ancient Lamp at the top of the tower with a demon of undead trapped inside. They keep the demon and their dead just in case the elves ever need an army to protect themselves. However, someone has quietly broke into the tower and is trying to call forth the undead army, under his own control.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tomb of Skal'Tor Resh</td>
<td>Crypt</td>
<td> Skal'Tor Resh was once among the most powerful individual on the face of the world. His tactical capabilities were unequalled, yet they paled in comparison with his mastery of the arcane arts. His desire for power led him into making one of the most deeply loathed deals ever known - he sold the souls of the whole of his nation in exchange for untold power as the champion of Hell. In such a fashion were the tieflings created, and in their anger they overthrew him. He was interred in this almighty cavernous crypt, designed as much to keep people out as to keep him in.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sacred Cenote</td>
<td>A Cenote that used to be a place of worship</td>
<td> As you descend the cool, wet stone steps into the cenote you can feel an unnatural presence surrounding you. You make it to the bottom and see an altar on the other side of a murky pool of water. A series of stone platforms seems to provide safe passage across the pool. Suddenly the water erupts violently and lashes out at you. What do you do?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Crypt</td>
<td>A crypt underneath a graveyard.</td>
<td> The entrance to the bottom level of the crypt is accessed through a secret tunnel underneath the only tombs sarcophagus. Upon descending the stairs you find yourself is a sort of waiting room with a portion of the west wall collapsed. Going through the collapsed wall you enter a natural cavern with a pool of water that leads to the natural cavern to the north. Heading north from the entrance to the bottom level is a hallway with sarcophagi lining the walls in alcoves. Continuing north you encounter a chapel to the dark gods and another collapsed wall leading to natural caverns. Heading down the staircase to the east you are faced with two options. South leads to a room lined with cells. North leads to what appears to be a room for performing dark rituals. There is also a staircase that leads to a hidden exit on the surface.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ancient Blood God Temple</td>
<td>Abandoned Temple</td>
<td> A long since forgotten religion devoted to blood left this temple and it was reclaimed by nature, the inside is relatively untouched. A simple layout, there are locked doors controlled by puzzles involving blood or similar fluid.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Driftwood Tree</td>
<td>Natural Formation</td>
<td> A species of tree that seems to be extinct, gigantic portions of these trees occasionally wash ashore. The tree has large natural spaces within it that become home to semi aquatic creatures when washed ashore. Many chambers will be water filled.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Soundless Halls</td>
<td>Cultist abode</td>
<td> An underground network of halls and small rooms designed to remove all sound and echo, people can barely hear each other in here, being alone can cause one to go insane. The cultists occupying these spaces believe sound corrupts the soul.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Giant's Puzzle</td>
<td>Ruin</td>
<td> Not a traditional dungeon. Ancient ruins in ring shapes, sometimes concentric sometimes spacey placed. The rings rotate when some of the ruins are interacted with (Usually via small puzzle or key). When the ings are aligned in a certain way "something happens".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Void Chambers</td>
<td>Deep Dungeon</td>
<td> Originally an ancient torture/imprisonment method. Huge underground areas (Sometimes several miles across) a carved out in hard stone areas, with minimal ventilation and very infrequent entrance/exits. The idea is that prisoners would be dropped in and never be able to leave. After being abandoned for a long time, burrowing creatures left the areas somewhat populated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hall of Drugs</td>
<td>Trial Dungeon</td>
<td> Great alchemists and healers, some banished for extreme practices. Have been know to take up residence in old crypts. Gatekeepers would keep visitors from progressing further until they try a drug the gatekeeper supplies, the afflicted would then face a trial of some description, before meeting the next gatekeeper/trial. These dungeons often reward visitors with potions or antidotes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Double Helix Dungeon</td>
<td>Dual-Dungeon</td>
<td> Two thin spiraling corridors with many doors, puzzles and enemies. Parties must enter each helix, the doors in the dungeon will only open when the other party has reached a certain point. If a party tries to backtrack all doors on the other helix will lock.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Burial mound of the Morakki People</td>
<td>Graveyard</td>
<td> Small burial chambers by an ancient people, it was practiced by the great people of this tribe to leave treasure in their graves, and allow any with sufficient skill to claim this treasure.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gusty caves</td>
<td>Natural formation</td>
<td> A network of narrow caves atop a mountain, wind blows harshly through them, making it dangerous to even enter. One day an entire bag of gold landed in a town at the base of the mountain, treasure hunters have since attempted to explore the caves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Adventures Guild Dungeon</td>
<td>Adventures Guild Basement</td>
<td> A prestigious Adventurers Guild requires official member's to carry a small metal insignia. This insignia can only be obtained from one place, the very lowest floor of their basement/dungeon. The dungeon is filled with a variety of trials designed to test if one is ready to be a top-class adventurer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghost Ship Eventide</td>
<td>The Eventide</td>
<td> An abandoned vessel is seen drifting in the fog on moonless nights, with ragged sails and not a crewman to be seen. It has been spotted near each of the six gates of the Dread Lich - gates which have long since been captured and closed lest those undead armies return.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vault of Arjuna / Forge of the Gods</td>
<td>Water Based Dungeon</td>
<td> A vast cavern carved down to magma, the Forge of the Gods is where the mighty smith set to work for a thousand days and nights to craft the armaments of the Heavenly Host before they went to battle their cousins in a brutal civil war. On the last day, Arjuna realized that he could not be part of the slaughter. He created a lake above his forge and hid his creations in an extra-dimensional vault, one only reachable by turning the turbines which once powered his bellows. The only thing he said is "My treasures will only return when my forge is left in ruins, vanishing like tendrils of vapor in a hurricane." To open the vault, you must drain the lake into the forge. The steam turns the turbines, opening the vault.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blackberry Falls</td>
<td>Village / Armpit of the Kingdom</td>
<td> Blackberry Falls is a stinking pit of a village located in the swamps beneath the eponymous waterfall. The town has no non-humans, no government, and only a lecherous priest and Butch the local thug to impose order. Everything stinks, everything sucks, and everyone is racist, xenophobic, or the doddering old buffoon who runs "Crispy Critters: Frog on a Stick!" Blackberry Falls, mistakenly presumed to be an idyllic riverfront paradise, is chosen as the site of upcoming peace talks. The players have been tasked with ensuring the town is up to the task.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Witch Hunt</td>
<td>Trap/Torture maze</td>
<td> As the adventurers walk through a forest they encounter twin brothers, one with a pitchfork and the other with a torch and shortsword. Upon questioning, the two brothers proclaim with naive gusto that they are on a “witch hunt”. The brothers will explain that there are witches living in a cabin in the forest who have been abducting members of their village and they intend to put a stop to it once and for all, inviting the party members to join them on their hunt. If the party does not accept the invitation, the brothers will continue on their way peacefully. If the party accepts the invitation, the brothers will lead them down the path to the witch cabin. They will crouch at the edge of the woods to observe the cabin, whispering tales of the witches’ kidnappings and evil deeds to the party. After a short time observing the cabin, the brothers will state that the witches must be out and that it would be best to wait inside and ambush them upon returning. The brothers will lead the party into the house, suspiciously looking around at the insides. If the PCs perform a search of the cabin, they can easily find a trap door which leads to the basement. The brothers will otherwise find the trap door and suggest that they go into the basement to wait for the witches so that they aren’t seen through the windows, and they will lead the way down. Once the entire party has entered the basement, the brothers will look around suspiciously, waving their torch. They turn toward the party and smile as their disguises melt away and they reveal themselves as the witches and they will be hunting the party. The basement goes dark, leaving the party to illuminate their own way and two cackling female voices will echo through the labyrinthine dungeon/basement. “We’re on a witch hunt… a witch hunt.” “A witch hunt a witch hunt...” “Run run run run...” as the witches run away from the party before combat begins. The dungeon will be played by the board game “Labrynth” with the PCs arranged in the center of the board and the witches dispersed. The witch monsters can each use their action to shift the rows and columns of the dungeon by placing a single random square. This ability has a three round cooldown (the dungeon can only reform once every three rounds). After the witches are defeated, the walls crumble away, leaving a grid of columns underneath the house with the illuminated ladder in the center of the game board. Monsters: 2 Hags</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flooded Mines</td>
<td>Underwater caverns</td>
<td> This seaside mine once provided ore and gems to the surrounding communities until the sea level rose and flooded it. Strange creatures from the depths now occupy its watery chambers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Glass Menagerie</td>
<td>Abandoned Atelier</td>
<td> These ruins were once the workshop and playground of a powerful wizard. Living glass creatures roam what were once gardens and buildings, attacking any who dare to enter.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Halls of Glauchrysos</td>
<td>Ant Tunnels</td>
<td> This labyrinthine tunnel complex was once home for a great Myrmidon queen known as Glauchrysos. She and her brood lived here and mined until they were driven out by the humans nearby. Since their departure, the fungal gardens have overgrown, and now the tunnels are inhabited by monsters twisted by plague.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Moaning Grotto</td>
<td>Natural Formation</td>
<td> This cave is named for the keening wail produced by wind blowing through it. It was (or perhaps still is) used as a hidden base by a rebel faction, who relied on rumors of it being haunted to keep their presence secret.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nine-Fingers' Keep</td>
<td>Castle</td>
<td> A wooden castle which houses the local baronet. While he once was generous, he has since squandered his wealth, and now is looking to replenish his coffers by other means.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jaundice Point</td>
<td>Natural Formation</td>
<td> At the westernmost edge of Cape Somerset, there is a great stretch of coast lined with cliffs. There is only one possible landing for ailing ships: Jaundice Point. But the point serves not as a safe haven so much as the entrance to a great maze of mud and fog and razor-sharp rocks -- and rumors of a strange creature lurking in the mist.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>City of the Crown</td>
<td>Ruin</td>
<td> The City of the Crown was the gem of human civilization before the rift opened and demons crept their way into the hearts of man. Now, it is home only to the Lord of Hate and his gibbering entourage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Belly of the Whale</td>
<td>Animal</td>
<td> The Leviathan dwells at the bottom of the ocean, a great whale that can swallow ships if it so desires -- and it does. Who knows what else has been devoured by the thing over the years. And what happens if the Leviathan and Behemoth have their great battle with the PCs still inside?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Labyrinth of the White Tree</td>
<td>Mythical tree with healing pattern hidden at center of maze</td>
<td> At the center of this maze there is a tree that bears magical fruit and is rumored to be able to bring someone back from the brink of death. There are reports of changing paths, deadly creatures, and things that go bump in the night. Will you be able to save your beloved by bringing out a fruit?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Labyrinth of Sword & Song</td>
<td>Ancient ruins that require 3 tuning forks to open</td>
<td> the labyrinth consists of 4 larger rooms with lots of tunnels connecting them with lots if dead ends and traps. 3 of the rooms contain a puzzle involving the 3 tuning forks. if all 3 riddles are solved correctly the party is given a sword that makes the final room with the boss fight significantly easier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fat Kroll's Kave</td>
<td>Single Room Hideaway</td>
<td> A modest, unmarked entryway leads to a dimly lit hall. No longer than needed to get away from the elements, a single room at the end of the hallway is illuminated by firelight. Inside, Kroll; a very fat, greasy and grumbly foe. Always angry, always hungry, Kroll responds to all intruders with yelling and scratching at the doorway to his room. He's too large to escape, after being brought foodstuff from an unknown source, he's trapped. Defeat Kroll, gain his belongings. There is enough space in the room to fight and remember, he's too big to get past the door!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vault of the Planes</td>
<td>Arcane Repository</td>
<td> Long ago a wizard was tasked with guarding a small trove of powerful items, and to only give them to those who prove worthy. He built an small pocket dimension as a vault with a long-forgotten entrance. When the adventurers discover the place he is willing to part with some of the treasures. However, in addition to the group proving themselves worthy, he requires entertainment of some kind, because he bound his soul to the vault shortly before death and has been bored ever since.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Dark Sepulcher of The Old Queen</td>
<td>Decrepit Royal Crypt</td>
<td> This sepulcher was created for the realm's queen long ago as she was dying. On her deathbed, mercenaries burst in and kidnapped her, taking her to the nearly-finished crypt. There, a necromancer planned to use her body for an undead experiment, but it went awry. With her dying breath, she cursed the sepulcher with undeath. She passed away, but - filled with rage - returned from the dead and killed the necromancer and his henchmen. Legend says they're still down there, shambling through the halls.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Scorched Rock Temple</td>
<td>Temple of Cultist of Fire</td>
<td> Deep inside Fires of Life (Volcanic Mountain), lies a sprawling temple dedicated to a long forgotten deity of fire. First to bring civilization to the humanoid populations, these previous miners, settlers, and blacksmiths had uncovered a terrible secret. Bonding with the elemental plane of fire, they slowly became more industrious. Over a period of many years, they slowed the amount of trade coming out of the mountain. Not long after, no one who went to see what became of the settlers came back. Inside is a sprawling city, devoted to the worship of fire. A crucible at the heart of the city feeds the forges, where they create not weapons of steel, or iron, but weapons of fire. Flame elementals roam the city streets, the people themselves are devoid of hair, many more have harvested the power of fire into powerful magic. Broken into quarters this city houses 6,000 fiery souls, and untold elementals. The crucible at the center of the magma chamber is used for worship 4 times a day. As they mine deeper into the mountain, seeking to create a physical connection to the elemental plane of fire. This is displacing typical cavernous creatures. Umberhulks, goblins, kobolds, druegar, dwarves, and illithid. Leading to multiple factions, and multiple nooks and crannies to fill with all sorts of motivations.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Troll Cave and under complex</td>
<td>Small cave system, where the rear has collapsed into a ancient Stone Giant Prison</td>
<td> Eons ago during the time of Giants, before their empires were destroyed by the coming of dragons, Stone Giants of the land created many wonders. This prison was one of them. Carved deep underground, it was made to hold some of the worst enemies of their Empire, and even darker forces. Ages past, and giants were scattered to the winds, their kingdoms gone, their cities charred rubble. The prison remained, forgotten underground. Many prisoners were left to starve in their cells. Some, bound by ancient and powerful magic live on, suspended in time by their heavy stone manacles. In the deepest levels a red glow can be seen, and mad roaring heard. Great and powerful demons were caught and bound here, to be shackled eternally.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Patchwork Dragon</td>
<td>Dragon's Cave</td>
<td> A gang of previously harmless kobolds begins raiding villages with the help of an odd looking dragon. A single young dragon is captured by hunters after a raid and they discover the Dragon is actually a rogue modron in a dragon costume...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Belly of the Purple Worm</td>
<td>A Shifting Dungeon</td>
<td> Your PC's are offered by the cult of the purple Worm, they are swallowed whole, now they must fight there way through the the beast itself. Encountering lost civilizations, whole town swallowed whole, as well as many creatures who have also been devoured by the Purple Worm.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Temple of the Silver Blades</td>
<td>Temple Ruins, Shadow/Plant theme</td>
<td> The Silent Vales are governed by a druidic council of Elves, Lizardfolk and Men, but half a millennia ago they were entirely under the dominion of the Council of Thorns. An elite order of spies and killers enforced their will, eliminating trespassers and silently removing threats to elven sovereignity. A spate of recent murders among high-ranking druids and shamans has the council on edge- something is stalking the leylines between sacred sites, emerging in their inner sanctums to dispatch its victims quickly and quietly. Rumor has it the Silver Blades were capable of travelling in such a manner, but the order was destroyed centuries ago, their temple crumbling and overgrown, predatory plants and feral beasts lurking in the ruins. None remain that possess the skills and knowledge of the Silver Blades... right?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The House of Light</td>
<td>Cliffside Monastery, Light/Wind theme</td>
<td> For the first time in years, the orcish tribes in the western badlands have sent emissaries to the border, suing for peace. The only problem is, the colonial authorities have no idea what they're talking about- the border has seen very little conflict for over a decade now, and neither side has been keen to start anything. Rumors trickle in, though, of pilgrims and devotees of Pelor flocking to a once-abandoned temple on the edge of orcish lands, of a holy army of spirits led by a resurrected paladin, and of something rocketing through the skies, sundering tribal camps with rays of searing light. Who is this knight, and why are they trying to restart a vicious campaign that ended centuries ago?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Emberhold Awakened</td>
<td>Dwarven forge-complex, Machines & Magma theme</td>
<td> The Embershard clan has been nursing a bitter grudge ever since their clan was exiled from the hold generations ago. Successful mercenaries and northern traders, their clan lord has recently mobilised a large number of clansmen and machinery. They travel by longship to the north, along the coast of the Worldspine mountains, in a bid to reclaim an ancient forge-complex built and operated by their forefathers. The complex is accessed through a fjord leading into the heart of Goliath territory- and worse, the entrance sits at the base of the Skyshard, the tallest mountain on the continent and the stone-skins most sacred holy site. The peace between native Goliath and colonial dwarves can be fragile at times, but the Embershards' actions may provoke a full-blown war unless the party stops them from reawakening the forge, and the fury of the arcane war machines that lay dormant within.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hyperborean Orrery</td>
<td>Frozen-over Mage's Research Facility, Ice/Magic theme</td>
<td> The last of the four heroes, the Archmage travelled far to the north to establish a research facility, from which she conducted magical experiments and educated those talented enough to reach her. The complex sits on a small island in the middle of a frozen lake, an expanse of ice that stretches for miles in every direction. After almost a century, however, communications stopped coming from the Orrery, and the pass that led to it was rendered inaccessible thanks to weather, landslides and a tribe of Goliath taking up residence. For those fool enough to travel the distance and brave the elements, there may be riches and knowledge beyond imagining. But the facility, half-buried in snow, crumbling walls exposed to the howling blizzards, is dangerous in itself. Traps, enchantments and magical constructs still defend the corpse-littered halls, and lost experiments may lurk in the wings, seething with madness and hatred. Worse, something pulses with arcane power and malevolent intelligence at the bottom of the facility, a chamber suspended within the depths of the frigid lake...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solipzoa</td>
<td>Gargantuan space creature</td>
<td> A creature that clasps onto buildings and planets, slowly driving the inhabitants insane. It can be controlled by the master who is able to command it psionically while residing in it's stomach. It keeps parasites inside it's body to get rid of the intruders it can see or taste within it's body. One way to keep intruders out is a sphincter full of teeth and eyes. One eye has a sensitive nerve that, when closed, will open the sphincter.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bifurcated Forks of Mentat</td>
<td>Extradimensional Maze</td>
<td> Mentat was a Psionicist and Diviner of great skill. He constructed this structure as a means to explore the possibilities of his past choices and those yet to come. His enemies took advantage of his meditative state while there and slew him unleashing the bound energies he was manipulating. Now the temple is an inhospitable place of strange angles, doors that lead to places they cannot, and rooms that should be impossible. It is said that anyone foolish enough to enter will face every mistake they've ever made come to life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tijd's Laboratory</td>
<td>Magical Laboratory</td>
<td> This is Tijd's Laboratory, constructed in a customised pocket dimension by Tijd himself, where he could do experiments on time-based magic in peace. The building is a 3 by 3 square of rooms, but in each room are two orbs that, when touched, transport you either into the far future or the far past of that room. The entry/exit is in the middle room of the 'present' slice. Tijd himself appears, frozen in some kind of magical crystal, in this room -- and the orb that takes you to this room's past is missing! This dungeon is one giant puzzle (with many potentially dangerous magical effects), as players have to find a way to get back to the past of the middle room, where Tijd is (presumably) about to accidentally seal himself in stasis, and rescue him!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dudek's Tower</td>
<td>Abandoned Tower/Glacier</td>
<td> This is an abandoned watchtower in the mountain passes that has slowly been buried by snow and ice -- it lies, half-leaning, half-toppled, back upon a steep slope of ice and rock. To scale the tower, you must pick your way both through ruined and crumpled rooms, and through caves and tunnels in the tumble of icy boulders behind. At the top lives a young white dragon, whose hoard includes a cursed sword...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grey Murk</td>
<td>Evil Swamp</td>
<td> This wetland lies near the old abandoned castle of the Grey family. Stories are still told of the gruesome murder of the Lord's family, and his descent into madness afterwards. Now a sinister presence fills the air here, and dancing lights through the mossy trees lure unlucky travellers to their dooms. Those who lose their way and die in this place rise up not long after as an undead. In the centre is a sunken crypt. Who is buried there?</td>

<td> Somewhere in the Hells is this horrible place. The Blood Pits are a series of claustrophobic tunnels and chambers, subject to erratic blasts of steam and scalding sulfuric acid, where the pit fiend Gujerikk personally torments his collection of souls. New arrivals are shackled and subjected to flaying, par-boiling, and witnessing the souls of their loved ones suffer (when possible). Once sufficiently broken, souls are released into the lower tunnels where they are endlessly hunted for sport by Gujerikk's hounds and the fiend himself.</td>

<td>The Crypt of Sir Gordan the Green</td>
<td>Sealed-off crypt within a large temple</td>
<td> Sir Gordan, called the Green Knight, was a celebrated hero of the wars with the mountain clans. On a moonless night, with only his squire, he slipped into the clans' camp, slaughtered two chiefs and brought a third out as a hostage to force an end to the conflict. He never liked talking about how he managed the feat. Years later he died, a respected old knight at court and was buried in the Crown's Temple, as befits a hero. On the first new moon after his interment, a young priestess was beheaded while tending candles at the temple's high altar. On the second new moon after his interment, an old woman was cloven nearly in two while praying in a chapel within the temple. On the third new moon, the temple was cleared save a veteran priest and demon-hunter and his assistant. In the morning, they were dead of sword wounds. Finger-painting in his blood the priest had left one word: "Gordan." Afraid to move the cursed knight, his crypt was sealed off completely. That was years ago, now a young priestess swears she can hear scratching and tapping below the temple on nights when the moon is dark.</td>

She keeps her larder well stocked with fine spices, cheeses, breads, butters, fruits, wines, ales, and animals for slaughter. Music often fills her the air in her second floor dining room. Though she loves to hear screams, she enjoys the change of pace. The upper chambers are filled with shackled souls she has collected. New arrivals are plump and juicy; long-time residents are shriveled and dried.</td>

<td>The Deadways</td>
<td>Burned-out catacombs</td>
<td> When the guildmasters plotted their rebellion against the ruthless lord of the town, they knew they must eliminate the lord, his family, and his closest allies in a single, swift action. The death of the king's son gave them just that opportunity. Before the interment, members of the alchemists' guild had rolled vast barrels of dragontar into the catacombs beneath the Temple of the Dead and dripped a trail to the three known entry points on the surface. During the interment, when the funeral party was all underground, the dragontar was lit, consuming all those participating in the ceremony. Occasionally, mischievous boys will find their way into the Deadways; they don't always find their way out.</td>

The original name of the monastery is long-since forgotten, but the local folk tell that the monks attempted to bind a fire demon in their pursuit of deeper and darker secrets as to the origins of the world. The tales suggest that the demon broke free and raged about the place killing every brother, servant, and visitor. I wouldn't believe such tales, but there have been several disappearances and several brush fires in the pass of late.</td>

<td> Carved into living rock far beneath the mountaintops once lay the mighty Irondark Hold. A vast stronghold that protected the dwarvish mining operations throughout the tunnels of the Iron Mountains, Irondark Hold is now sodden home to a foul thing. The thing whispered to the Lord of Irondark of the rich deposits of diamonds that lay in solid rock beneath the fortress. Haunted by dreams of glittering gems, the greedy lord dug more and more tunnels directly beneath the fortress, creating an unstable network of tunnels. One day, when the Irondark Legion returned from a campaign against the goblins, the tunnels beneath the fortress collapsed. The fortress crashed through nearly 200 feet of tunnels before resting for a few moments on a floor of stone that cracked and gave way before the fortress plunged 2,000 feet into a shallow subterranean sea. The thing that whispered still haunts the broken stones of Irondark Hold. Several dwarvish expeditions have been lost attempting to recover ancestral weapons and relics that had been in the fortress.</td>

Driven mad by the voices of those he had killed or raised, he created a lair in which to hide. As each area of this complex was finished, he would decide where it would go from there. The workers would follow his orders out of fear and greed as he paid well. This led to a twisting turning maze of chambers, hallways, and stairs; many of which led nowhere. Eventually, Meerlac, driven to utter madness, was unable to communicate with others and his workers abandoned him in his lair where he roamed wildly until his death and perhaps still roams it today.</td>

What is known is that they are located in the depths of a dark swamp and that they stand on the only truly solid ground available in the area. The commonly held rumor is that there is a dark magic at work inside that remains from the days when the ruins were a keep. This magic seems to have had an effect on the rats that have made their home there, leading them to be smarter, bigger, and aggressive. Some even speculate that the rats who have become intelligent enough to gain sentience have started a cult worshiping an ancient god they discovered in the chapel of the keep. While they have not yet, some fear that soon the rats will begin raiding nearby settlements for blood sacrifices for their new found deity.</td>

<td>The Midas Vault</td>
<td>Forbidden desert treasure complex</td>
<td> More than a century ago, an incredibly powerful -- and quite insane -- mage accumulated a massive hoard of wealth. But so paranoid was he of thieves and pilferers, that in order to protect his fortune, he decided to spend some of it to build a massive vault in the middle of a vast desert. Its exact location has since been lost to time and the shifting desert sands, but according to those who claim to have found it, from the outside, it appears to be a plain single-story stone building with a single entrance and a few small windows, but the structure extends deep underground, and is filled with many traps and hazards, magical and otherwise. As you descend, you will see larger and larger stashes of gold coins and bars, all minted with the mage's face. You will also encounter beasts and monstrosities that are attracted to gold and treasure, having been lured there by the sizable hoard. At the bottom-most level is a massive vault room where the mage's remains lie among his mountains of gold, having locked himself in shortly after the structure's completion. Unfortunately, even death won't be enough to keep him from letting go of his fortune.</td>

<td> Eons ago, an unknown entity built this massive, magically-automated facility to ceaselessly manufacture golems to use as an endless army of servants and soldiers. Now, whoever built this place is long since gone, but the arcane machinery functions still. Perhaps it's been running nonstop since it was created, or perhaps it went dormant for untold years and has just reawoken; in either case, the factory is producing golems around the clock now, and these servants are performing their tasks as they were programmed to. They scatter throughout the lands, collecting raw materials to use in the construction of new golems, resulting in an ever-growing swarm of automatons of every shape and size, all built using the consumed resources of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, the required materials are beginning to become scarce in the area, and the swarms of golems are expanding their search further and further -- its only a matter of time before they encounter modern settlements. What's worse, any party looking to shut down the factory are in for more than they bargained for, as the massive golem "overseer" won't take kindly to any attempts to harm his reason for being.</td>

<td>An Old King's Lair</td>
<td>Ornate Underground Burial Chambers</td>
<td> An old King of the campaign world was a next level narcissist, and decided that when he died he would be buried in a tomb that would properly reflect the splendor of his life. So, he designed a burial chamber that would reflect just how amazing a man he was. He laid out his chamber so that visitors would have to pass through multiple rooms to reach the chamber he was actually interred, and each room would be a scene from his life. The first room was a replica of the playroom he spent his childhood in. The second room was a replica of his classroom where he demonstrated his early brilliance and awed his teachers (that's how he remembers it.). The third room was a sparring ground where he showed his extreme proficiency with all known weapons (again, that's how he remembers it.). And so on. Each room was a detailed recreation of his life showing the splendor and glory that he brought to the world (again, as he remembers it, history and reality may remember it differently.). But, he wasn't a fool, he knew there would be those who might attempt to rob his tomb, and so each room was also well stocked with Golems, or Animated objects that would attack any who entered. The toys in the playroom would spring to life and attack, the books in the classroom would hurl themselves at intruders and explode, the weapons in the sparring ground would attempt to do bodily harm to those entering, etc.</td>

If one is picked up, the rest animate, skittering away like cockroaches. Dispel magic will stop one coin at a time. Anti-magic fields will stop all coins in their range. If the party drops something broken on the ground, the coins will group up and shove it out. The walls are perfectly smooth, with perfect right angles. Everything is spotless. Blood from battle is quickly caught and run outside by coins. Any opponents are exemplars of their type (in appearance). Final opponent - likely an Elf spellcaster of almost painful beauty (male or female). S/he grew an obsession with perfection, and has created a home without flaws. If any party members have visible scars, tattoos, or other physical flaws, s/he will target them first, regardless of logic.</td>

Nevertheless, the vision of the Empress had been hewn from stone and sweat and silver, and even as the riots swept the streets below, the temple priests - decked in vestments of ermine and velvet - sealed the royal family and their wealth behind ten feet of iron. Now, twenty years hence, the gilded priesthood guard the temple still, patrolling long corridors, tending to the complex locks, and serving as intermediaries between the voices that speak in hushed tones from within the central vault and the outside world. That the royal family hasn't been fed in almost fifteen years is of some small worry to the priests, but their loyalties are clear - to stop any unauthorized bank access with all due force.</td>

Settlers, driven by a lust for the wealth in electrum-laden streams, vie for territory with the ravenous creatures. In an attempt to better prepare themselves for the flesh-hungry cannibals, a volunteer corp of the Scrimshaw Expeditionary Company willingly underwent 'lycanthropy therapy' in one of the deeper frontier encampments. The results were never guaranteed, and while news from the outer edges of civilization is scarce, rumors suggest that (depending on your perspective) things went either terribly wrong, or wonderfully right. Regardless, representatives of the SEC have been surreptitiously contacting independent adventuring companies, promising heavy coinpurses for anyone willing to bring back evidence that the Wendigo War is going in their favor.</td>

Built into and around a squat upthrust knuckle of basalt, Saunt Lupine Abbey is centuries older than the order that inhabits it, with tunnels and passages running below and through that are even older. Most of these have long been sealed or gated off by the Abbey's current tenants, but some of the old network can be accessed through sea caves on the backside of the island, and are regularly used by smugglers as a staging point for shipments south. Questioned, both the religious and the roguish will hesitantly speak of the deeper tunnels, beyond the shaped and buttressed ones of their domain. There, they say, lie machines older than the abbey or the island both, humming quietly in dark recesses. If disturbed, dark mechanical sentinels rise up in defense, slaying all that dare trespass.</td>

This is the only verifiable history recorded on the Contraption. The origins of it are unknown. Since the fall of the wizard, who's name has been magically removed from history, the Contraption has moved on its own across the land. It is not unoccupied, however. Many constructs have found their way to the Contraption and have taken up maintenence and living there. The Contraption holds untold dangers and likely very few treasures after these centuries past. Still, magicians from all the Plains have sought it. The Contraption is itself an implement of magical work, and is itself the prize.</td>

Surprisingly, Orvizar is said to have made a great discovery before the abnormal magical activity attracted the attention of one of the denizens of the plane. The entity subsumed the plane, absorbing it such that the workshop itself is inseparable from the creature.

<td>The Vault of Tested Faith</td>

<td> For many decades, the ancient monastic order of the Crusading Spirit sent its new recruits to Erhaben's Mount, to be schooled at the temple of the same name. Over the years, the order's sorties recovered many artefacts deemed 'unholy'; the majority of these were destroyed. Of those that weren't, some were brought to the school for use as academic study, and eventually the collection of these built up in the vaults beneath the temple until they reached a critical mass. Unperturbed, the monks devised a new use for the vaults. Young boys' minds were always prone to wandering, straying into thoughts not proper for one being shaped into a noble crusader. The order instituted a new test, a way to reaffirm in the minds of their pupils what the real cost of straying from the true path would be. Deviants were sent in to the vaults, and left to find a route through. Such were the unholy terrors that had accumulated in those depths, many of the boys were overcome and joined the ranks of the undead things - or worse - that prowled in the darkness. But those who came through were reaffirmed in their faith, and often grew to become some of the most bold leaders of that great order. Of course, unholy power of that magnitude could not be contained forever, not with such regular feeding. In time, the contents of the basement overflowed, the temple reduced to an empty and desolate shell. But it still stands today; no-one dares to scrounge the masonry from its walls, and only the most foolhardy would dare to enter the vaults themselves...</td>

The Quagmire is subterranean series of tunnels that lead into a depressed cavern that has been filled with the local swamps fumes and runoff. The smell is noxious and the prisoners are locked within personal cells that separated by their moats and long walkways. If a prisoner tries to escape, the floor to the cell falls out, causing to plummet down into the murk, where various monsters and poisonous plants have made their home.

The deepest chamber contains much treasure, but the most important thing is a beautiful jeweled dagger on a pedestal. When entering the chamber, one is immediately attracted to this dagger above all else. When one holds the dagger, one is suddenly overcome with an incredible desire to sacrifice oneself then and there to the Cave. When this occurs, the living stone shifts and consumes the corpse, then waits for its next victim. The other treasures within are from consumed adventurers, and if those who enter make the Cave impatient or are somehow satisfied with the little they find in the various antechambers, the Cave spawns ashen ghouls from the living stone who share consciousness with the Cave; so it is that the Cave of Wonders can feed passively or actively.</td>

Chasms open up now and again to reveal flecks of blue visible from the floor of this maze. Hoodoos and spires mate with crumbling crevasses and cavern entrances to produce a semi-subterranean, semi-superficial lair for a host of nasty critters. Why anybody would venture through is beyond the capacities of the locals, but this path could cut days from your journey, and you're already running low on supplies. Admittedly, there are untold dangers within; nobody has ever returned from here after staying just one night.</td>

But untold reward is said to await for those who do, as the accumulated knowledge of both the red monks, and the red knight order is kept in the libraries of The Red Keep. But the knights of scarlet guard it fiercely. The fort is a large high-walled fort, made to protect the passage between Ferline, and Erguri.

The Beacon Tower is the highest tower of Salt Rock, and it serves as both a watchtower and a functioning lighthouse. To descend from the castle to the harbor takes half a day, but signal fires and messenger pigeons keep the garrison and fleet apprised of any threats spotted from the castle above. Short of scaling the slippery cliffs of Holgar's Point, the narrow road up to the keep is the only way to reach it, making it impossible to take by force, but it has fallen by siege at least once. The Rock's dungeons are said to be connected to a vast series of underwater caves where some foul beast of the sea sleeps. It is whispered that the Carlocks keep the sea monster satisfied with meals of prisoners. No one who has ever left the Rock's dungeons alive has seen the caves or the monster, but those former prisoners all agree that the dungeons are cold and damp and that the sound of waves crashing on rock seems to rise up from somewhere inside the walls.</td>

The old aristocracy, unused to having their influence usurped, fought a losing war of charismatic attrition, and before long the balance of power began to tip toward the Mercantile and its allies. In a last bid to capture the hearts of the people - many of whom had suffered greatly during the various Mercantile blockades - the joint Dukes of Il Ipron formulated the first Braggard's Lottery, the winner of which would become Mayor for a year, neatly circumventing the existing elections. The lucky citizen would be given all the rights and duties of the post, as well as all the perks - namely, the Mayor's Mansion - and decent sum of money. The unpublicized downside was that these annual mayorships tended to be incredibly stressful, and were essentially tools used by the Dukes to enforce their will on the influential port town, and wreak their grievances on any who worked for the Mercantile.</td>

<td> The mighty delvings of the Northforge Dwarves, carved into the living rock of the Greyghost Mountains. As the younger of the two dwarven kingdoms on the continent, its mines do not run as deep, but its position on the last front of the War of Conquest has given cause for extensive aboveground fortifications, including a moat of boiling volcanic spring water. The moat, combined with the bitter cold of the Greyghosts, usually results in Northforge being obscured by vast plumes of steam. Northforge was established during the days of the Dwarven Exodus, when Bjorik Breakhammer's ships were separated from those of his brother by an intense storm. Half of the dwarf fleet went south, and the other half went north, eventually leading to the establishment of two separate dwarven kingdoms. The Northforge Dwarves battled the cold and the snow, as well as the myriad barbarian tribes of the mountains, before finally stumbling upon a cave with edible flora and fauna. It was a difficult time, but those battle-hardened few that remained took their freedom from the indifferent chill of the Greyghosts.</td>

The locals offered the Dwarf-Prince-in-Exile membership in the Sholai Confederacy, as well as food and supplies for the establishment of their own kingdom. This assistance resulted in Southforge being much more quickly established, as a larger population survived to build their home. Southforge, thus, is far deeper, but with fewer surface defenses. This, of course, is even more true since the Latona Republic glassed the peninsula. The outer rock face of Southforge Bastion bears the telltale gloss of formerly molten stone that was blasted by the horrendous magicks of the Latona wizards. Following the horrific incident, Southforge has turned almost entirely inward, building deeper and deeper into the Glasspeak Mountains that house it.</td>

When it fell in the War of Conquest, hundreds fled the destruction, followed by thousands more when they realized the Republic had no interest in garrisoning the blasted shell of the Fort. Its battered walls and shattered fortifications were silent. For a while. Now, Sir Throck, Knight of the Ashen Star, a death knight of the former Confederacy, has risen again to continue the war his people lost some seventy years ago. He and his risen soldiers are rebuilding Fort Underfell once more, and the dark shadows cast from the damned keep are beginning to reach up into civilized lands.

The chalk is never far below the grass that covers the mound, and it shines in the right light, sun or moon. Atop the mound is a rudimentary fort surrounded by a huge circular ditch edged with ramparts and a viciously spiked stake-wall palisade. The combination of the mound's unnatrually steep incline, the depth of the ditch and the crude fortificaitons makes the exposed camp at the summit very difficult to take without great magic, flying mounts, or enormous siege machines. And the hill tribes haven't seen much of any of that in these uncivilized parts. Not in living memory at least. The origins of Samor's camp are lost in history. How the mound came to be so symmetrical and so steep is not known, though many will tell a story of Samor's blood pact with the long dead Lunic Druids and their use of a Great Wyrm to shape the land to their whim.

<td>Citadel of Ash</td>
<td>Volcanic Watchpost</td>
<td> The Citadel of Ash was constructed hundreds of years ago upon the ocean-facing slopes of a (somewhat) dormant volcano when the continent was united under a single empire. The purpose of this citadel was to watch the eastern sea for invaders that threatened this new empire, as the atoll that it calls home is the easternmost landmass of the continent. "The Citadel of Ash" began as mostly a nickname but it became so popular among the troops stationed there and the local population that its original name has been lost to time. When it was constructed, the citadel was made of a brilliant white stone. Within a small amount of years it was permanently blackened by the constant ash falling upon its walls and the name has stuck through the generations. To be stationed at the citadel was perhaps the worst assignment on the entire continent as the guards were likely far away from their families in populated cities and at risk to an early death due to the constant ash, steep slopes, and occasional catastrophic eruption; but hey the view is nice! While the atoll it resides on has remained well populated and prosperous, the population of the citadel has dwindled over the years even with new governments to own it. Once it became clear that threats from the eastern sea were likely never coming, the staffing began to dwindle down to a mere handful of men. In recent years it is all but abandoned, with but a few daring climbers and explorers willing to brave the soot-covered slopes to reach the citadel. Now tales are told of dangerous beasts and merciless criminals who occupy the citadel, rather than of ever vigilant brave men. But are these tales to be believed?</td>

The cult's goals are mysterious, but townsfolk near the citadel sleep poorly, with twisted nightmares. The uninitiated who spend any time within the walls find themselves exhausted and slow, drifting slowly to an uneasy sleep. The dome travels, disappearing with the morning dew after a period of time, spending most of its time absorbing the other planes' dreams in the Astral Plane.

<td>Lookout Point</td>

<td> Lookout Point is a 7 story tower that stands atop a seaside cliff above Quintcyville, a quaint, seaside village. A generation ago, pirates were constantly raiding the up-and-coming trading port of Quintcyville, so the tower was constructed to defend the merchant fleets in the harbor and spot incoming raids on the town. Eventually, the pirates were defeated, but the town was decimated and most trade was routed through a rival port, leaving the local economy locked in recession. A kid named Tor started leading local kids up to tower to play pretend adventures against the long-gone pirates. When Tor was older, he expanded that practice taking wealthy nobles and their spoiled children for a thrilling taste of real adventure. Safe, but appealing to their vanity, they could claim to have done something noteworthy. Soon, the town's entire economy built around Tor's adventures, which was the invention of Torism. The town now features numerous overpriced inns, taverns, shows, and shops. The tower has a few harmless monsters and a few hidden surprises.

<td>The Fort of Atlas</td>
<td>Mobile Fortress</td>
<td> The Fort of Atlas seems, initially, much like any of the others scattered across the sweeping plains of the Western lowlands. It takes a roughly rectangular shape, with a large multi-towered central superstructure rising from within forbidding, sloped walls. There is very little in the way of internal empty space, merely some relatively narrow walkways between walls and keep. The first inkling of the fortress's unusul nature might come from these; rather than being covered in grass, they are paved in the same wide dark-grey bricks as the rest of the structure. They seem just too wide for a single man to defend effectively, but awkward for two to fight side-by-side. But the men and women who inhabit here have no intention of doing any fighting themselves. Without warning, the structure trembles for a second, and then rises up before you, and begins to move. Now the defenders of this otherwise rather quiet keep become obvious; an army of golems, each half again the size of a man and with ten times the strength. Thus does the fortress appear to 'wander' across the landscape, borne upon the backs of unshakeably loyal servitude. So too do these golems serve as its defence in the castle's time of need - the numerous access points to the understory allow them to appear from any and every direction at once, quickly surprising and surrounding any attacker who thought to simply stroll in to the apparently empty grounds. These golems are also of course the main attractant for (some of the more foolish) invaders - to wrest command of such an army away from its current owners would drastically shift the balance of power, in the cut-throat military game of the lowlands.</td>

Made out of the hobgoblin chief's inborn hate for the elves, this fortress was made as a hideout and base of operations for one of the most influential goblinoid tribes in Findon (World). The walls rise high between 4 square towers and above these walls lies the "keep", or the headquarters where the leaders discuss battle plans. No one has ever attempted to break in and rumors about the ominous place have spread throughout all of lower Findon.</td>

<td>Where does this treasure map lead?</td>
<td>You drop down onto the sand, salt-rimed boots quickly sinking into the soft grains. Before you is a cave, barely above sea level, even with the low tide. You lean in close, holding the candle as close to the map as you dare. Sure enough, here it is...</td>
<td> Since we're hip-deep in the mire that is the underworld, and since our last event gave us a veritable hoard of ocean-related loot, it's only fair that we find some places to put it. We're looking for deserted island caves filled with slick, treacherous rock and pirate gold, underwater temples of the kuo-toa, or even the lair of the elusive Leviathan itself. If it's dark, dank, and filled with treasure, this is where you put it. These dungeons don't have to be completely fleshed-out, but make sure you provide a fairly decent picture of what the dungeon is and who's living in it. Two or three sentences should be pretty solid. I'll provide some examples. Now...</td>

<td>Grotto of the Ocean King</td>
<td>Ancient Sunken Temple</td>
<td> This temple lies below the waves, as an eternal symbol of the fallen Ocean King. He failed to take proper reverence to the gods of the sea, some say he attempted to take their place, and they grew angry with him. No one knows what currently inhabits the temple as it has laid beneath the waves for centuries.</td>

<td>Sunshine Island</td>
<td>Ocean locked penal colony</td>
<td> A barge the size of a mid sized island this floating fortress is home to exactly two types of people. The worst criminals the seafaring kingdom has to offer and the people paid large amounts of coin to watch them. The ship contains a treasure trove of goods confiscated after the scoundrels were incarcerated, much was smuggled in within bags of holding making this penal colony a treasure trove for would be pirates and less noble adventurers alike.</td>

<td>The Forbidden Ocean</td>
<td>Uncharted Territory</td>
<td> A quarter of the worlds largest ocean remains entirely unmapped due to constant storms. Islands abound and sometimes can be seen at a distance however only one man has ever managed to sail the ocean safely. He claims all you need to do is follow a certain path and you will get past the storms and into the calm waters around the island chains, but his chart is long lost with him and no one else dares to venture in.</td>

<td>Goldwater Grotto</td>
<td>Limestone caverns</td>
<td> Far to the east, on an island shrouded in mists, lies Goldwater Grotto. A series of awe-inspiring caverns hidden away beneath the island, the Grotto is both famous and infamous among the few sailors and privateers who know of its location, for one reason: the pool of water that sits at the very bottom of the caves. The water is immaculately clear, and incredibly still--so still, in fact, that you can see the mountains of treasure that lie on the bottom of the pool, many many meters down. The pool attracts treasure seekers, thieves, and brigands from miles around, none of whom is too keen on someone else getting to the loot first...</td>

<td>Whitecliff Keep</td>
<td>Ruined coastal fortress</td>
<td> Whitecliff Keep was built some hundreds of years ago as both a lighthouse and a forward defensive outpost for the ancient kingdom that built it. Unfortunately, the eponymous white cliffs it was built on were not simply decorative; they are composed of soft, erosion-prone chalk. Centuries of high tides and typhoons have crumbled the cliffside, and now only about half of the original Keep is still standing. This has not stopped a collective of merrow from inhabiting the ruins and using it as a vantage point to spot unsuspecting merchant vessels for attack...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Maw of the Sea</td>
<td>Deep sea prison</td>
<td> Only the oldest and darkest of merfolk tales tell of the Maw of the Sea. In the time before time, a great and terrible beast roamed the oceans, consuming all life and causing horrific storms and tsunamis. It took divine intervention to catch the creature and lock it away in the deepest, most lightless part of the ocean. Not a soul who has attempted to delve that deeply has returned to tell of it, but those who venture close have told of the deep, shrieking song that emanates from the trenches beneath the sea...</td>
