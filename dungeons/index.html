<tr><th>Dungeon Name</th><th>Dungeon Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Hole in the Hills</td>
	<td>Abandoned mine</td>
	<td> This abandoned copper mine has recently been occupied by a band of displaced and hungry goblins. These goblins have been making raids against the local sheepherders. They carry off sheep because the sheep don't seem to fight back as much as the sheepherders do.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Hilltop Ruins</td>
	<td>Castle ruin</td>
	<td> This ancient ruin would have held a commanding view of the valley. The place is so old that no one really knows who built it. Despite it's lack of known history, there seems to be a new and unpleasant denizen living in the cellars and dungeons of the ruin every week.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Frozen Caverns of Gr'guth</td>
	<td>Ice caves</td>
	<td> Below the mountains, far to the north, Gr'guth the Mighty Frost Giant King holds court. Gr'gurth's court is a pretty dull place, since there are rarely visitors in his cold and inhospitable realm. He leaves the front door unguarded and waits impatiently for guests to arrive for dinner. If you can't find your way through the mazes of tunnels to meet your host, you needn't worry: his wolves will find you.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Sitadel</td>
	<td>Primary stronghold in the Puppy Realm</td>
	<td> This world is an unending sea of puppies rising and falling like turbulent waves in an ocean. The Sitadel is made of compact and shaped puppies and holds their most valued and malicious of the PUPulation. High up in the Sitadel's towers reigns the most powerful illusionist puppy in the realm Booo, forever looking like the cutest stuffed animal puppy. In contrast, down below in the darkest dungeons resides the most mangy lot imanginable, the Pound Puppies.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Sacred Sky Burial of the Elves</td>
	<td>A heavily trapped tower</td>
	<td> The elves have long buried their most glorious dead on top of or within their Sacred Sky Tower. They bury them with their most precious items, armor, and weapons. This temps would-be grave robbers and adventurers and thus the elves have made each level leading up to the tower a labyrinth of puzzles and traps. What most don't know is that there is an ancient Lamp at the top of the tower with a demon of undead trapped inside. They keep the demon and their dead just in case the elves ever need an army to protect themselves. However, someone has quietly broke into the tower and is trying to call forth the undead army, under his own control.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Ancient Blood God Temple</td>
	<td>Abandoned Temple</td>
	<td> A long since forgotten religion devoted to blood left this temple and it was reclaimed by nature, the inside is relatively untouched. A simple layout, there are locked doors controlled by puzzles involving blood or similar fluid.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Driftwood Tree</td>
	<td>Natural Formation</td>
	<td> A species of tree that seems to be extinct, gigantic portions of these trees occasionally wash ashore. The tree has large natural spaces within it that become home to semi aquatic creatures when washed ashore. Many chambers will be water filled.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Soundless Halls</td>
	<td>Cultist abode</td>
	<td> An underground network of halls and small rooms designed to remove all sound and echo, people can barely hear each other in here, being alone can cause one to go insane. The cultists occupying these spaces believe sound corrupts the soul.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Giant's Puzzle</td>
	<td>Ruin</td>
	<td> Not a traditional dungeon. Ancient ruins in ring shapes, sometimes concentric sometimes spacey placed. The rings rotate when some of the ruins are interacted with (Usually via small puzzle or key). When the ings are aligned in a certain way "something happens".</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Void Chambers</td>
	<td>Deep Dungeon</td>
	<td> Originally an ancient torture/imprisonment method. Huge underground areas (Sometimes several miles across) a carved out in hard stone areas, with minimal ventilation and very infrequent entrance/exits. The idea is that prisoners would be dropped in and never be able to leave. After being abandoned for a long time, burrowing creatures left the areas somewhat populated.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Hall of Drugs</td>
	<td>Trial Dungeon</td>
	<td> Great alchemists and healers, some banished for extreme practices. Have been know to take up residence in old crypts. Gatekeepers would keep visitors from progressing further until they try a drug the gatekeeper supplies, the afflicted would then face a trial of some description, before meeting the next gatekeeper/trial. These dungeons often reward visitors with potions or antidotes.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Double Helix Dungeon</td>
	<td>Dual-Dungeon</td>
	<td> Two thin spiraling corridors with many doors, puzzles and enemies. Parties must enter each helix, the doors in the dungeon will only open when the other party has reached a certain point. If a party tries to backtrack all doors on the other helix will lock.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Burial mound of the Morakki People</td>
	<td>Graveyard</td>
	<td> Small burial chambers by an ancient people, it was practiced by the great people of this tribe to leave treasure in their graves, and allow any with sufficient skill to claim this treasure.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Gusty caves</td>
	<td>Natural formation</td>
	<td> A network of narrow caves atop a mountain, wind blows harshly through them, making it dangerous to even enter. One day an entire bag of gold landed in a town at the base of the mountain, treasure hunters have since attempted to explore the caves.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Adventures Guild Dungeon</td>
	<td>Adventures Guild Basement</td>
	<td> A prestigious Adventurers Guild requires official member's to carry a small metal insignia. This insignia can only be obtained from one place, the very lowest floor of their basement/dungeon. The dungeon is filled with a variety of trials designed to test if one is ready to be a top-class adventurer.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Flooded Mines</td>
	<td>Underwater caverns</td>
	<td> This seaside mine once provided ore and gems to the surrounding communities until the sea level rose and flooded it. Strange creatures from the depths now occupy its watery chambers.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Glass Menagerie</td>
	<td>Abandoned Atelier</td>
	<td> These ruins were once the workshop and playground of a powerful wizard. Living glass creatures roam what were once gardens and buildings, attacking any who dare to enter.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>The Tomb of Skal'Tor Resh</td>
	<td>Crypt</td>
	<td> Skal'Tor Resh was once among the most powerful individual on the face of the world. His tactical capabilities were unequalled, yet they paled in comparison with his mastery of the arcane arts. His desire for power led him into making one of the most deeply loathed deals ever known - he sold the souls of the whole of his nation in exchange for untold power as the champion of Hell. In such a fashion were the tieflings created, and in their anger they overthrew him. He was interred in this almighty cavernous crypt, designed as much to keep people out as to keep him in.</td>
