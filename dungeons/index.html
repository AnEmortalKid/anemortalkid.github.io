<td>What's in this place that reeks of death?</td>
<td>Your footsteps echo loudly as you climb down the stone staircase into the silent dark. In the flickering torchlight, you see a stone sarcophagus at the far end of the chamber. Is the lid open? Suddenly, there is movement to your left...</td>
<td> A tomb can be distinctive by the art and architecture of its builders, the fame or notoriety of the person interred therein, the strange things that happen to those who venture within, the rumors of treasure that may be stored inside, and the unintended denizens. Every tomb tells the store of someone's life and death, but ancient and haunted tombs likely tell many stories... I'll post a few examples.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pine Hill</td>
<td>Mass grave</td>
<td> There are no trees on Pine Hill. Indeed, there's not much hill, either; it's really more of a broad, grassy mound of soft earth. Should you find a particularly soft patch, however, you might find out exactly what it was made for. Under the thick layer of sod is a series of tunnels and warrens, dedicated to one purpose: the storage of thousands of bodies. The muddy wooden floor is actually the lids of innumerable, unmarked pine coffins, stacks of which form the walls as well. Tales from those few who have managed to crawl out of the maze of pine boxes tell that while many of those buried are nameless, faceless, and buried with nothing, a few bear the marks--and trappings--of great wealth. Careful with that axe, though... you never know when Pine Hill will chop back.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pine Ash Pond</td>
<td>Ash Marsh</td>
<td> The site of a previous mass burial site that was filled with pine coffins. A group of reckless adventurers caused a fire to run rampant on the burial site rousing some of the dead. Now Pine Ash Pond is a marsh swarming with ash caked scampering skeletons.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Anumir’s Slumber</td>
<td>Forest Tomb</td>
<td> A small cave, its entrance choked with vines, is the final resting place of Anumir the druid. In life the he protected the forest and all of its creatures, in death the favor is returned.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Celerik’s Folly</td>
<td>Stronghold Turned Tomb?</td>
<td> The stronghold’s walls were thick; the spells were all in place, none could enter or leave. Celerik and his followers would survive the coming apocalypse and their descendants would emerge to repopulate when the spells fell and lands were once more inhabitable. The prophecies never came to pass, centuries have gone by and the spells have fallen, yet none emerge…</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Mausoleum of Karak Jabbal</td>
<td>Desert Tomb</td>
<td> Beyond the Red Sand Waste in the shadows of the Diamond Mountains is the magnificent mausoleum of the ancient prince Karak Jabbal. An adherent of the Way of Light, Prince Karak built his monument on a promontory that receives a cleansing bath of sunlight every dawn as was the prince's custom. The prince did not plan for the powerful curse placed upon this place. Every afternoon, when the sun dips below the mountains, the dead walk about this place. The corpses of workers who perished in the monument's construction were buried in the sand near the foundations, and they are not welcoming to visitors.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Great Burial Mound</td>
<td>Primitive Burial Site</td>
<td> One of the oldest known tombs in the world appears as little more than a small hillock on the river's floodplain. Many travelers have mistaken the burial mound for a hill, on which they can keep watch in the night. What they have not planned for are the wights that emerge from the mound in the wee hours who attempt to drag any above below into their dark tunnels. On a stormy night, the tunnels are especially treacherous as the river is likely to swell its banks and drown any living things unfortunate enough to be inside the mound.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tomb of St. Anglos</td>
<td>Urban Tomb</td>
<td> Beneath the cathedral is the resting place of the legendary knight St. Anglos who slew the sea dragon Karadaxos, paving the way for the village at the river's mouth to become the thriving center of trade that it is today. The tomb has been sealed off to most pilgrims for two decades, but wealthy merchant families still do homage to St. Anglos's bones on nights when the moon is new. Rumors suggest that the wealthy citizens who visit the tomb are part of an offshoot death cult of the Sea Queen, but those are just rumors, right?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Jack's Rest</td>
<td>was</td>
<td> In the quaint town of Derrin-upon-Smarn they take pride in their yearly celebrations of All-God's-Eve, a time to joke about demons, make decorations and generally make fun of all the enemies that the God's have acquired in their long existences. Each autumn the townsfolk have a competition to see who can grow the largest pumpkin, gorging on pumpkin and pumpkin related treats. When they are done they pile the pumpkins and jack-o-lanterns in a valley to the west of town. All is well with this lovely little town and its lovely little tradition. One year a young lad named Jacob decided that his jack-o-lantern, although it wasn't particularly large, would at least be on the top of the pumpkin pile! He climbed to the top as the rest of the village watched, cheering him on. He placed his pumpkin on the peak of the pyramid, had one joyous moment and then-! Disaster. The pyramid fell and crushed Jacob to death in front of his young friends, his family and the entire village. The body was never recovered. They stopped the ritual for a while, but as the years passed they started to do it again. It has taken on a sombre tone. The woods and the farmland around the pyramid has started to change. The trees never grow leaves. Ravens roost there year round. And this year... This year young children have started to disappear. Each time a child vanishes a pumpkin appears beside the pyramid, complete with a lit candle behind a jaunty face. Some say they've seen a hole in the pile of ancient vegetable matter - a hole large enough for someone to go inside. To go and see where Jack rests.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Echo Hall</td>
<td>An ancient church library</td>
<td> A church famous for helping wayward women deal with the sin of giving birth. A woman, filled with dread and prone to the vapours, who left her child on a shelf, without swaddling clothe or comfort. She ran away, and the child was not found until the next day, when it was too late. Since then the children brought to the church sometimes fall mysteriously ill and die. Each time one dies the Hall changes slightly. Noises are heard. Things move. It is unnaturally cold - the chill of being naked and alone in a strange new world. Mutters and Echoes. Footsteps, voices and the shuffling sound of someone leafing through the pages of a book. All of these things Echo backwards and forwards, a dozen times at least, sometimes growing quieter, but just as often getting louder with each rebound.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Temple of Itet</td>
<td>Desert Ziggurat</td>
<td> This ancient ziggurat lies deep in the bone-littered desert known as the Vale of Vultures. Its exterior has been ravaged by wind and time, but its interior is as beautiful as ever: exquisite sculptures of long-dead sultans, enormous murals of exotic gods painted in black and gold, and columns so tall their upper reaches disappear into shadow. The Temple was originally intended to house the mummified bodies of the Sultans of the Vale, but after humans abandoned the Vale, a tribe of black jackalweres reclaimed the Temple for their God-to-Be, Itet. Once an ordinary jackalwere, Itet fell in love with a werewolf named Naatha, a notorious murderer and priestess of the Fellowship of Demise, which worships all gods of death regardless of alignment. Naatha rejected Itet's love, claiming she loved only death. Itet vowed to become a god of death and kill all others, making him synonymous with Death and thus the object of Naatha's love. Though not a god yet, Itet has already transcended his mortality, attaining a form similar to that of a wraith. He dwells on the highest floor of his Temple, guarded by jackalweres, specters, and mummies. Itet wears a tattered black robe over the gold-bejeweled attire of a pharaoh and wields a stylized scythe.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Mollusks Last Rest</td>
<td>Dead Giant Snail</td>
<td> Millions of years ago, a titanic snail searched the seabed for food, but as a living being it died and washed ashore. The coast smells bad around these parts and the ground is soft. A low pitched howling can be heard at all times. It becomes stronger with the storms as gusts of air fly through the windings of a broken shell. The smell of rotting fish and algae fills the mist around those daring to enter the corridors, fragile and riddled with holes. Some mad fisherman told me that the center was made out of pure pearl, but why should I believe him? The other day he said that the dead fish inside were walking too. What a silly old man.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Salted Fields</td>
<td>Air Burial Ground</td>
<td> Since anyone can remember, the mountain tribes have laid their dead on this plateau to be eaten. The ground is littered with bones and their fragments, most of them gnawed clean and broken to get that delicious marrow. Vultures and flocks of smaller birds can be seen circling above during day, but during the night, the feast begins. Lately there have been human screams during the birds' meals, it appears that not only the dead are brought here.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Groundhog Stone</td>
<td>Primitive Death Cult Tomb</td>
<td> The Groundhog Stone is a monolith sitting on top of a cliffside that, when seen from the valley below, looks vaguely like a Groundhog. Beneath it are tunnels, dug straight through dirt and rocks with no struts. Many have entered, the few who came back were... different. Below the maze, riddled with the animated bodies of those who got lost, lies the hall of the late Groundhog King. Every night him and his subordinates hold the same feast, which they had on their last day. They will invite any adventurer who arrives to join them. It is a firework of gluttony, debauchery and lust, culminating in a shamanic ritual. Every man and woman is given a mug of poison which kills them, but raises them the next day to keep feasting.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pilgrim's Shelter</td>
<td>Small Mountain Hut</td>
<td> Less and less people have taken the pilgrimage these days, too many didn't return. The hut lies a days climb from the holy mountain's icy peak, just below the tree line. There is a natural well with clear water and a reserve of firewood for the cold nights. A dense pine forest encroaches on the small clearing, and by night you can hear otherworldly howling outside. Behind the hut lies a small field with clean cut grass. A few dozen unhewn flat rocks are spread out on it, memories of those who did not make it, freezing in the ground. Back in the day, groups of pilgrims would spend their night in front of a flickering stove and prepare for the final sprint. They say a warm fire inside will lure the pilgrims. Even the dead ones.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Professor Scatty's Lab</td>
<td>A Door in the Academy's Basement</td>
<td> Nobody has been in these cellars for ages. The old tracts had been sealed after a few too many experiments with the wrong kinds of magic, and the renovated west wing proved much more comfortable than the lightless hallways beneath it. At the end of one of those corridors, a rune of protection is etched into a rotting door. The walls behind it are lined with flasks, jars, and alchemistic tools. Most of the flasks contain a dead creature or a miniature golem. One of the cabinets emits a faint glow, the ghostly inhabitants are screaming and banging angainst the walls of their prisons. In front of it lies the mangled corpse of the Professor, and a shattered bottle.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Forsaken Throne</td>
<td>The Catacombs Of A Palace</td>
<td> Disappearing children are nothing new in the capital. Most of them weren't even noticed. Orphans and beggars, abducted in the night by people in dark robes, never to be seen again. They take them towards the hill that the palace was built on, but none reach the gates. They disappear in sewers and tunnels, into the shadows. Ages ago, the palace was not on a hill. It was in the middle of the city, its golden minarets glowing from the fire around it. The Lich had broken the eastern gate and his skeletal hordes were torching every house in sight, when a magic blast from inside the palace turned the building into rubble, and all undead fell to the ground like puppets. Since then no necromancer has touched the city. The ones who tried saw their undead minions return to their lifeless form before they could even reach the city gates. The new palace was built on the rubble of the previous one. Soon, people forgot about the old keep under the hill, and what may still be inside. It is a throne room. Desecrated by bloody runes and ancient rituals, where thousands of children were gutted to feed their souls to the king. The old king is still sitting where he last sat down, when the gate fell hundreds of years ago. Harnessing the magic of his seat, protecting his city, but at what cost?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hells Kitchen</td>
<td>A Seemingly Regular Graveyard</td>
<td> The Graveyard started smelling after the last flood. Bodies were flushed out of their supposedly final resting place, some of them scattering all over the place. The smell has gotten worse lately, burnt flesh mixing with the unmistakable odour of decay. Some blame it on the lazy undertaker, who doesn't properly burn the bodies. Others however savour it and flock to the crematory for a midnight snack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Smugglers Rest</td>
<td>Multiple Shipwrecks</td>
<td> Rounding the this hazardous point you come upon the welcoming and calm waters of Smugglers Rest. This deceptively calm natural harbor is filled with sharp hidden reefs, and notoriously aggressive sharks. Near to shore sits a pile of ships smashed against one cliff face. There are also numerous wrecks sitting on the bottom. Many of them are connected by rotting rope bridges and gangplanks. The long abandoned crews have been driven mad by the isolation and hunger. They will now eat anything or anyone they come across.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tomb of Sergi Blackshield</td>
<td>Urban tomb</td>
<td> Deep inside the sprawling City of the Dead lies the tomb of the noted warrior Sergi Blackshield, who held Blackshield Pass against an ork horde for two days and two nights. He was buried with his ancestors and his coffin surrounded with the Black Roses of Mourning that grow in darkness, and hundreds of mourners followed the funeral procession into the graveyard. Sadly, the Blackshield line died out many generations ago, and now his tomb is crumbling, dusty and choked with fallen rubble. But the grave keeper has heard strange noises from inside and has found booted footprints near the tomb. Who would go there- what lies within?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dungeon of Scarlet Rot</td>
<td>Hidden Necropolis / Lich's Lair</td>
<td> Hidden below the surface of the earth where the town of Wyrmsfall stands is a menacing secret. When Scarlet was plagued by visions and nightmares of unnamable creatures from the Far Realms the town laughed it off. But Scarlet became obsessed with stopping the events she saw from happening. Craving more and more knowledge about the Far Realms and those events she pushed the limits of her arcane abilities. Scarlet sealed herself away preforming the rites needed to achieve Lichhood until she could prevent the events she saw that usher the end of the world. Namely those adventurers from ever finding the tome of the yellow king.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Lich's Study</td>
<td>Mountain Laboratory</td>
<td> Long ago, in the south where the forest meets the mountains, a Lich ruled. He was slain, his phylactery destroyed, by an Elf lord and his knights. However, few beings are willing to touch or investigate the works of the necromancer and so his haunts are scattered across the mountains. The relics of amazing power, the gruesome experiments, and the concocted horrors still reside there and torment those who dare venture near them. The most common of the Lich's residences are the laboratories where it would experiment upon the bodies of the living and dead. Tombs lie here, many still containing countless deceased and other things ready for experimentation, undisturbed since he was destroyed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Tomb of Lunacy</td>
<td>Tomb with multiple split, converging, and dead end paths</td>
<td> As PCs explore the hallways, no matter what direction they choose to try to take, they always take the path the monster in the middle desires them to. They're convinced it's the path they chose themselves. Each player needs to make a DC20 WIS save to break the effect, and anyone still under the effect won't believe anyone trying to tell them what's happening, convinced they're the ones that are confused. Path monster has them take is riddled with traps. Any lasting effect ends when the monster is defeated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vittesno's Rest</td>
<td>Forest Burial Site</td>
<td> An enchanted glass coffin of a lost princess in a peaceful grove of the forest. Inspecting the coffin reveals it is easy to remove, revealing a burrow beneath. Within are the emaciated corpses of nine gnomes, seemingly trapped in the burrow since the coffin blocked their exit. The air is moist and warm, and a rotten, half bitten apple eerily glows at the end of the table, and is extremely cold to the touch. The presence of the wasted gnomes can still be felt, and wailing seems to echo from the sub-basement door.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Iron Glade</td>
<td>Former Battlesite</td>
<td> A few miles directly south of Volandar, in amongst a copse of trees and terrain that heavily favors south facing soldiers, is, what appears to be small abandoned town, no more than a few miles across, with buildings mostly in tact, the ravages of time have taken their toll upon this place though. Upon closer inspection one notices amongst the the thick bladed, long grass and reams of varied flora, are weapons, hundreds upon thousands of weapons of all kinds and colours dug into the ground. Underneath these weapons are rotted suits of armour and corpses, as the town reaches it's centre the corpses stop being a singular horrifying occurence and become a surface all of their own, bodies of men women and children rotted away and burying one another, all facing the plaza, swords, axes, repurposed farming implements all in hands driving into the ground. At the central fountain is a singular body on it's own, the sickeningly reddened water bathing it in blood, with a gold hilted sword thrust through it's head.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Penitence</td>
<td>Execution Ship</td>
<td> Charred black and barely hanging together The Penitence lists among the open seas, the last great purge of Eastern Seapath, pirates by the scores rounded up by the score and chained to the hull, inside and out, by the hands and feet and cast out into sea with a barrel of oil and a lit candle. All the rigging is constructed from thick built chain and drape almost every inch of the ships surface and interior hull, the bodies of those captured chained in place from so many points they sit motionless even amongst the rocking waves like listless flies in a spiderweb. The only moving man is a figure so strapped in encassed it is impossible to make out chained to the iron wheel of the ship.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Findol's Leap</td>
<td>Forest Tomb</td>
<td> Deep in the forest where the wild elves roam, below the crag known as God Finger lies the tree-lined tomb of Findol the Brave, hero of the elves of light in their war against the elves of dark. A accomplished wizard and warrior, Findol led his people upon the rocky spur of the God Finger as a last resort when the huge host of dark elves and their slaves set upon them. Giving a last salute to his people, he leapt from the crag some hundreds of feet to the waiting army below using his own life force to weave a spell that turned all not upon the crag into trees. In an instant, the conquering army became pine, maple, elm, and oak with the impenetrable heart of them being the place where Findol's body made contact with the ground. To this day, thousands of years later, the elves honor and cherish his grave, visiting death upon any elf who dares enter the surrounding forest. Still, adventurer's sometimes try to pass the elves by stealth or magic to enter the open air grave of Findol for it is said he took to his death a number of fantastically powerful magic items.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Catacombs of Mentis "The Silent"</td>
<td>Urban Catacombs</td>
<td> During his reign, Emperor Mentis built a lavish palace from which he ruled for nearly five decades. Over the years, he became increasingly paranoid of foreign intruders and his own subjects alike. He spoke to no one and even went as far as to forbidding any noise inside the walls of his palace. Those who disobeyed this law payed a heavy price. He then ordered the construction of a large maze of walls around his home to confuse his enemies. The walls, big enough to permanently house his armies and their families, were no match for the volcanic eruption that happened years later. Everything was engulfed in ash and soot, transforming the impenetrable fortress into a mass grave. A new city was built over the old, but legend has it, many of these walls are still intact just below the surface, creating a maze of catacombs. Some may even lead to the buried palace, where the Emperor himself supposedly still remains. Anyone who dare enter these tunnels be wary as to not disturb the eerie silence, for even in death, his word is still law. Edit: Some clarification</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Foechuckle's Tomb</td>
<td>The grave of a famous bard and his consorts</td>
<td> The Halfling, Zaneak Foechuckle was a well-known fighter and bard, much loved throughout the land. Tales of his musical battle with an Archfiend, his victory of wits over the Dragon of the Mountains, and his wooing of no less than a thousand princesses are told in all the realms. When he finally died, it was a great day of mourning in the realm. A tomb had been prepared for him and he was laid to rest among his gathered treasures. At first it was visited by pilgrims seeking to honor their hero, but in recent years its been avoided. Around fires people speak softly of a woman in black who creeps along the tomb's halls. Some say she is a jilted lover, refused burial with Zaneak and his wives. Others say she is the Archfiend Zaneak trapped years ago, attempting to trick a wanderer into giving it its freedom. Whatever the case, her screams are said to be heard reverberating from the tomb late at night striking fear into some, and striking others dead.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sepulcher of the Unknown Warriors</td>
<td>Desert Barrow</td>
<td> Beneath the largest dune of the Scarred Expanse, lies the organized remains of a unknown number of soldiers. Their mummified remains have been cared for and organized by the nation and heraldry they bore in life. Each of the countless bodies stand in small recesses at attention presenting their arms and armor as if awaiting command. Scholars puzzle over the nations represented by the bodies as they match none in the current catalog of heraldry. Some theorize that this barrow has existed in some distant previous age that is lost to modern recollection. Expeditions into the barrow have encountered resistance by unseen forces who ask politely at first for intruders to leave. Should the requests be denied manifestations begin to plague the explorers as torches go out, water-skins burst, and other anomalous happenings befall the explorers. If those manifestations fail to drive the intruders out then horrifying manifestations of spectral beings swarm the explorers ending their lives. Subsequent expeditions have found the bodies of those lost explorers be cared for just as the other bodies with seemingly random equipment given to them. The network of tunnels have never been fully mapped as it appears the tunnels beneath the barrow shift. Prior maps made of the barrow appear inaccurate in later explorations of the barrow leading some to hypothesize the entire structure moves itself periodically beneath the sands.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Marsh of Ran'dee</td>
<td>Wetland</td>
<td> The Marsh of Ran'dee is known for the extremely tall reeds that border its waters. Strong winds brush over the tops of these reeds, simulating various howling noises that mimic a human in pain. Traces of ectoplasm can also be found around the grasses, leaving many to believe the marsh is haunted. The ecology of the marsh is somewhat of a mystery. Almost all of the research has been lifted from personal records of various individuals and is difficult to verify. Locals deem Ran'dee too unnerving to study. However, there have been multiple reports of disappearing and reappearing roosters. The marsh was discovered by a low-level hunter named Falcorn. Unfortunately, not much is known about the individual. Lore has it, the hunter enjoyed the marsh as an escape from his mundane life. Supposedly, you would often find him alone, monologuing to himself, while consuming copious amounts of alcohol.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Warlord's Rest</td>
<td>The single most protected building in the world</td>
<td> The Warlord, centuries ago, almost conquered the world. If not for a coalition of all the races he would have succeeded. When crafting the tomb they came together once more. Protected it with strong wards, top level craftsmanship and art on the walls, depicting each of his conquests so no one would ever awaken him. Undead were set to guard the tomb so no one could reach him, it is protected by the best every race could offer. At the the bottom lays his corpse. It must never be awoken.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Deep</td>
<td>Open concept, theme each floor separately based on your needs</td>
<td> Spanning an unknown number of floors this crypt is quite unique. One hundred years ago the entrance surfaced and a dead man walked out, proclaimed any who reached the bottom would inherit his kingdom. Since then tens of thousands have died making the attempt. There is a market on the topmost floors, almost an entire thriving economy as adventurers make ever more dangerous treks through the halls once littered with gold. Each floor is almost a magical realm in and of itself, untold in size, monsters repopulate frequently, however gold does not. there are as yet unknown shortcuts through the tomb that may still contain dangerous traps and riches, but they remain to be found.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Keep of Mel'Shon</td>
<td>Crumbling fortress of an extinct race of giants, filled with giant skeletons</td>
<td> "It is a fortress", the old man said. "An ancient Keep manned by the dead. An evil lurks in that place that I have never known before." Mel'Shon was the last line of defense for the extinct goliath kingdom of Melmora. The blood splattered on the gigantic, crumbling walls of the fortress tells a gory tale. A tale of war, of struggle, and of death. The keep, however, is very much alive. The skeletons within still cling to the thin strands of memory they have left. They can be heard doing the menial tasks of their life throughout the keep. A hammer repeatedly strikes an anvil; The sound of dishes rattle in a basin; an undead choir chants a chorus for a long-dead god; a creaking wheel turns ever slowly. And Golgoth, The Goliath King sits on his throne and waits. But where skeletons walk, a Necromancer hides in the shadows, pulling the strings like a dark puppetmaster.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Illusionist's Crypt</td>
<td>Ancient Crypt of Dark Elf Illusionist Master</td>
<td> Before the Drow forsaked their elven brethren and withdrew into the Underdark, there were the Dark Elves. A grand race of people unparalleled in the arcane arts. One such Elf was an Illusionist, a grandmaster of the craft. Over a thousand years ago, Before he died, he built a tomb for himself, his family and all of his most precious posessions. Many powerful magical arifacts rest in the tomb with him but very few have what it takes to pry them from his resting place. In fact, many have died trying. The Illusionist's Tools are too powerful for most to wield safely so he devised a series of traps, riddles, and puzzles so only the most dedicated and worthy adventurer could come to have them. A guantlet. A true challenge no adventurer could ignore. Seems simple enough. But beware; In the Illusionist's Crypt, Nothing is as it seems.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Warden Stone</td>
<td>Single tomb</td>
<td> Amongst the flagstones near the gate of Algrought Castle, one stone rests an inch or so above the rest. Nicknamed the Warden Stone by the castle denizens, it is supposed to be the resting-place of the castle's first combat death. The reality is far more disturbing: the watchman was snuck upon from inside the castle, killed, dismembered, and butchered. What the madman who slew him did not eat, he buried beneath the flagstone, at the spot where the brave man had stood hours earlier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cearabour Bog</td>
<td>Pit grave</td>
<td> Cearabour is the most treacherous bog in the kingdom. Only a somewhat-marked path crosses it, requiring the greatest caution and perception to avoid sinking into the mires. One spot in the bog harbors the crumbling remains of four brave knights, set upon by a jealous cousin and hurled singlehandedly into the muck. Though mail rusts and bone corrodes, their holy swords lie untouched in the still waters, forgotten.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hadian Bridge</td>
<td>Long-suffering causeway of pain</td>
<td> It has been many ages since the Fall of the Six. Their bodies, chopped up and pillaged by the Dark Lord, were put to use in maintaining the defense of his dark fortress. The conglomerated bones of the Six formed some of the base structures of the bridge to the fortress's main gate. Legend says that the non-structural bones had a worse fate: They were corrupted by the dark arts and fused into a horror of bone and rage, to guard their master's crossing forevermore.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Moorhallow Cairn</td>
<td>Barrow</td>
<td> North of the sleepy village of Moorhallow lies one of the largest barrowlands ever made. Travel even further north of these barrows and you will find the ruins of a great city in the shadow of the mountain. The name whispered through the centuries of this lost city goes by Cirn Delwaith. It is rumored in the barrows of this lost city rest the greatest of all barrows only known as The Moorhallow Cairn. 5 Lords of the city are interred in this above ground barrow. They were not dead when they were sealed in the tomb but trapped as a punishment for their ancient misdeeds. Some adventurous travelers say that you can still hear pounding on the inside of the stone seal, even after the many centuries.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Summer's Rest</td>
<td>Monument</td>
<td> The Auden Wood languishes in autumnal twilight, buried under heaps of desiccated leaves, some of which still cling to the gnarled branches of grand old oaks and twisted silver birches. Ominous shadows seem to gather in the deep parts of the forest, and when the day's light begins to fade, those unwise enough to linger in the Wood return with stories of an edifice of wrought iron and dark stone that lingers in the periphery of their vision. Some perceive it as a portent of what's to come; to others, an artefact of something that occurred long ago. But all agree that the dark obelisk marks the place where bright and bountiful Summer came - and/or will come - to die.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Glade of the Dreamless Sleep</td>
<td>Forest, undeath</td>
<td> Among a sea of exceptionally tall trees among a soft bed of decades worth of pine needles and leaves, a dense fog seeps near-constantly. Everywhere around, figures lay propped against the base of almost every single tree trunk. The figures each appear as if they are in a deep and comfortable sleep, but there is no pulse and strangely, no decay. This is especially odd considering a few of the bodies wear outfits and ornaments that have long since passed being fashionable, centuries ago. The longer anyone stays in this foggy area, the more and more lethargic and sleepy they become. Beware the Dreamless Sleep.</td>

<td> Irrion Hallfindel was a bard, famous throughout the land, his compositions were played in every hall and palace throughout the world. One night, he was visited by what seemed a friendly Djin. The Djin offered him an instrument with which he could make even the mountains weep or rejoice. Irrion gladly accepted and took the Instrument, a beautifully decorated Violin. His venue, the once Cathedral turned Concert Hall was packed with people and full of exited cheer. Irrion presented his Violin and went to play a composition which streamed into his hands as he played, called the Risum Mortem. The composition was a moving and very emotional one, but it was much more.... As he played the old bones buried beneath the church started to stirr, the decomposing bodies of those long dead arose to the surface. The guests found themselves unable to move, overcome by the music. In the end, the entire Hall went to ruin, unable to be cleared of the Bards Dreaded Song..... Some say the Bard is still playing, others say he died long ago. Maybe its just a story, who knows?</td>

The Point is lined with narrow crevasses carved out by the sea, with a large blowhole in the rock, which explodes with frothy water whenever the waves slam against the cliff-face. The blow hole was little more than a local curiousity (especially due to the eerie whistling and moaning of the water as it is forced out of the rock) until one day it began spitting coins and treasures along with sea-foam and water. But for years people have scoured the point looking for an entrance to any cave or any other way to retrieve the treasure without any luck. Because the blowhole itself is deadly - waves pummel anyone who enters it or suck them deep out to sea, and there is not enough time between the waves to really see what lies in the blowhole or at the seacave where the waves force their entrance, even on a calm day. If there was a way to somehow to stop the water or cut through the stone, then it would be possible to discover the caves that have deeply undercut Moon Point, and that the eerie noises from the blowhole are not merely the sounds of water forced through stone, but the howls of the drowned long pushed between the rock into the waterlogged caves.</td>

Beneath the Storm Dragon's pagoda the priests performed profane rites by encasing sacrificial victims, both human and animal in molten gold. Stories tell of a cataclysmic storm that covered the whole island in hundred foot waves and battered down the fruit trees and the thatched roofs with unmatched winds—as if the Storm Dragon itself had grown angry and meant to make an example of the place.

Up close, the steep sand seems almost vertical, but there are shelves of compacted sand, the occasional tree trunk and streaks of sand in colours from deep brown to orange. The cliffs can be climbed but they are treacherous - the sand can slip at any moment sending even experienced climbers tumbling. Perhaps this is why the pirate band choose to hide their treasure here, in plain sight? The most logical way to retrieve the treasure would be to tie ropes to the thin scrub at the top and slide back down the slopes, but the spears of the local tribes hiding in the scrub will make that difficult, and the large eagles who nest at it's peak will definitely not tolerate any intrusions.</td>

However, those who are familiar with their history can recall the exploits of Linus Farswallow, an industrialist who a hundred years ago was hellbent on exploiting deep ocean resources. Farswallow poured his entire fortune into creating a fully mechanised mining complex miles below the ocean surface. The venture, dubbed "sea world" appeared to be a success when Linus unearthed a strange glowing ore with fantastic magical properties. Sadly, this success was short lived, as Linus disappeared under mysterious circumstances shortly after. Every sailor worth his salt has heard of Redemption Isle, many have even been saved by its mysterious "lady". It is said that if one finds themselves perilously lost at sea, they may pray to the "Lady of the Isle" for redemption. Those who then throw themselves into the sea, and therefore at the feet of the "lady", will awake naked upon the Isle's sandy shores.

All other approaches are either choked with thorny brambles or made impassable by ditches filled with slick mud and sharpened stakes, but according to the locals, it's for the best. The defenses that have kept looters and adventurers out for almost fifteen years also serve to keep whatever lurks in the ruined factory in; during storms, they say, when the wind comes off the ocean, you can hear the screams and the howling hunger of the workers who were left shackled to the machinery when the Manufactory was abandoned.</td>

But untold reward is said to await for those who do, as the accumulated knowledge of both the red monks, and the red knight order is kept in the libraries of The Red Keep. But the knights of scarlet guard it fiercely. The fort is a large high-walled fort, made to protect the passage between Ferline, and Erguri. The walls are made from an unknown metallic substance, and they are said to be indestructible. Many a person (and/or creature) has tried to breach the walls of The Red Keep. But none has succeeded.

The Beacon Tower is the highest tower of Salt Rock, and it serves as both a watchtower and a functioning lighthouse. To descend from the castle to the harbor takes half a day, but signal fires and messenger pigeons keep the garrison and fleet apprised of any threats spotted from the castle above. Short of scaling the slippery cliffs of Holgar's Point, the narrow road up to the keep is the only way to reach it, making it impossible to take by force, but it has fallen by siege at least once. The Rock's dungeons are said to be connected to a vast series of underwater caves where some foul beast of the sea sleeps. It is whispered that the Carlocks keep the sea monster satisfied with meals of prisoners.

In a last bid to capture the hearts of the people - many of whom had suffered greatly during the various Mercantile blockades - the joint Dukes of Il Ipron formulated the first Braggard's Lottery, the winner of which would become Mayor for a year, neatly circumventing the existing elections. The lucky citizen would be given all the rights and duties of the post, as well as all the perks - namely, the Mayor's Mansion - and decent sum of money.

<td> The mighty delvings of the Northforge Dwarves, carved into the living rock of the Greyghost Mountains. As the younger of the two dwarven kingdoms on the continent, its mines do not run as deep, but its position on the last front of the War of Conquest has given cause for extensive aboveground fortifications, including a moat of boiling volcanic spring water. The moat, combined with the bitter cold of the Greyghosts, usually results in Northforge being obscured by vast plumes of steam. Northforge was established during the days of the Dwarven Exodus, when Bjorik Breakhammer's ships were separated from those of his brother by an intense storm. Half of the dwarf fleet went south, and the other half went north, eventually leading to the establishment of two separate dwarven kingdoms. The Northforge Dwarves battled the cold and the snow, as well as the myriad barbarian tribes of the mountains, before finally stumbling upon a cave with edible flora and fauna. It was a difficult time, but those battle-hardened few that remained took their freedom from the indifferent chill of the Greyghosts.</td>

The locals offered the Dwarf-Prince-in-Exile membership in the Sholai Confederacy, as well as food and supplies for the establishment of their own kingdom. This assistance resulted in Southforge being much more quickly established, as a larger population survived to build their home. Southforge, thus, is far deeper, but with fewer surface defenses. This, of course, is even more true since the Latona Republic glassed the peninsula. The outer rock face of Southforge Bastion bears the telltale gloss of formerly molten stone that was blasted by the horrendous magicks of the Latona wizards.

When it fell in the War of Conquest, hundreds fled the destruction, followed by thousands more when they realized the Republic had no interest in garrisoning the blasted shell of the Fort. Its battered walls and shattered fortifications were silent. For a while.

Atop the mound is a rudimentary fort surrounded by a huge circular ditch edged with ramparts and a viciously spiked stake-wall palisade. The combination of the mound's unnatrually steep incline, the depth of the ditch and the crude fortificaitons makes the exposed camp at the summit very difficult to take without great magic, flying mounts, or enormous siege machines. And the hill tribes haven't seen much of any of that in these uncivilized parts. Not in living memory at least. The origins of Samor's camp are lost in history.

<td>Citadel of Ash</td>
<td>Volcanic Watchpost</td>
<td> The Citadel of Ash was constructed hundreds of years ago upon the ocean-facing slopes of a (somewhat) dormant volcano when the continent was united under a single empire. The purpose of this citadel was to watch the eastern sea for invaders that threatened this new empire, as the atoll that it calls home is the easternmost landmass of the continent. "The Citadel of Ash" began as mostly a nickname but it became so popular among the troops stationed there and the local population that its original name has been lost to time. When it was constructed, the citadel was made of a brilliant white stone. Within a small amount of years it was permanently blackened by the constant ash falling upon its walls and the name has stuck through the generations. To be stationed at the citadel was perhaps the worst assignment on the entire continent as the guards were likely far away from their families in populated cities and at risk to an early death due to the constant ash, steep slopes, and occasional catastrophic eruption; but hey the view is nice! While the atoll it resides on has remained well populated and prosperous, the population of the citadel has dwindled over the years even with new governments to own it. Once it became clear that threats from the eastern sea were likely never coming, the staffing began to dwindle down to a mere handful of men. In recent years it is all but abandoned, with but a few daring climbers and explorers willing to brave the soot-covered slopes to reach the citadel. Now tales are told of dangerous beasts and merciless criminals who occupy the citadel, rather than of ever vigilant brave men. But are these tales to be believed?</td>

<td>The Dreamcatcher</td>
<td>Astral Observatory</td>
<td> Encompassing a perfect alabaster dome topped with a golden capstone stands a great wall, marked off at four corners with tall, elegant spires. There is no gate to the hidden chambers within. Deep inside the dome, it is said that the leaders of a cult gather to read the dreams of the world, ever staring out, never letting others see in. The cult's goals are mysterious, but townsfolk near the citadel sleep poorly, with twisted nightmares. The uninitiated who spend any time within the walls find themselves exhausted and slow, drifting slowly to an uneasy sleep. The dome travels, disappearing with the morning dew after a period of time, spending most of its time absorbing the other planes' dreams in the Astral Plane. In the perspective granted there, it becomes clear that the Dome is really the eye of a long dead deity of dreams and nightmares. Those who know this have tried to wrest the eye's power out of the cult's hands and use it for themselves.</td>

<td>Lookout Point</td>
<td>tourist trap</td>
<td> Lookout Point is a 7 story tower that stands atop a seaside cliff above Quintcyville, a quaint, seaside village. A generation ago, pirates were constantly raiding the up-and-coming trading port of Quintcyville, so the tower was constructed to defend the merchant fleets in the harbor and spot incoming raids on the town. Eventually, the pirates were defeated, but the town was decimated and most trade was routed through a rival port, leaving the local economy locked in recession. A kid named Tor started leading local kids up to tower to play pretend adventures against the long-gone pirates. When Tor was older, he expanded that practice taking wealthy nobles and their spoiled children for a thrilling taste of real adventure. Safe, but appealing to their vanity, they could claim to have done something noteworthy. Soon, the town's entire economy built around Tor's adventures, which was the invention of Torism. The town now features numerous overpriced inns, taverns, shows, and shops. The tower has a few harmless monsters and a few hidden surprises. Three weeks of each month, the Torist industry rakes in a fortune from the vanity of visiting nobles. But the week of the full moon, when the Pirates were most likely to attack, all the tower's magical defenses come alive....</td>

<td>The Fort of Atlas</td>
<td>Mobile Fortress</td>
<td> The Fort of Atlas seems, initially, much like any of the others scattered across the sweeping plains of the Western lowlands. It takes a roughly rectangular shape, with a large multi-towered central superstructure rising from within forbidding, sloped walls. There is very little in the way of internal empty space, merely some relatively narrow walkways between walls and keep. The first inkling of the fortress's unusul nature might come from these; rather than being covered in grass, they are paved in the same wide dark-grey bricks as the rest of the structure. They seem just too wide for a single man to defend effectively, but awkward for two to fight side-by-side. But the men and women who inhabit here have no intention of doing any fighting themselves. Without warning, the structure trembles for a second, and then rises up before you, and begins to move. Now the defenders of this otherwise rather quiet keep become obvious; an army of golems, each half again the size of a man and with ten times the strength. Thus does the fortress appear to 'wander' across the landscape, borne upon the backs of unshakeably loyal servitude. So too do these golems serve as its defence in the castle's time of need - the numerous access points to the understory allow them to appear from any and every direction at once, quickly surprising and surrounding any attacker who thought to simply stroll in to the apparently empty grounds. These golems are also of course the main attractant for (some of the more foolish) invaders - to wrest command of such an army away from its current owners would drastically shift the balance of power, in the cut-throat military game of the lowlands.</td>

At first glance uninhabited, entering the halls stirs up all manner of ghostly creatures. Benign apparitions of the staff go about in sad mimicry of their previous lives, while an aggressive and tortured ghost wards off any would-be visitors, or treasure hunters following tales of ghostly riches. This guardian is none other than Prince Casper, once the heir to the throne of a kingdom that covered the entire broad valley. Madness, murder, and betrayal are the common threads in the stories told of his father's last days, but they all end with the Prince - a powerful mage - going mad with grief, releasing a blast of energy that obliterated the castle and much of the valley, leaving behind the crater and ghostly manse that remain to this day.</td>

One day, when the Irondark Legion returned from a campaign against the goblins, the tunnels beneath the fortress collapsed. The fortress crashed through nearly 200 feet of tunnels before resting for a few moments on a floor of stone that cracked and gave way before the fortress plunged 2,000 feet into a shallow subterranean sea.

They scatter throughout the lands, collecting raw materials to use in the construction of new golems, resulting in an ever-growing swarm of automatons of every shape and size, all built using the consumed resources of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, the required materials are beginning to become scarce in the area, and the swarms of golems are expanding their search further and further -- its only a matter of time before they encounter modern settlements.

He laid out his chamber so that visitors would have to pass through multiple rooms to reach the chamber he was actually interred, and each room would be a scene from his life. The first room was a replica of the playroom he spent his childhood in.

Each room was a detailed recreation of his life showing the splendor and glory that he brought to the world (again, as he remembers it, history and reality may remember it differently.). But, he wasn't a fool, he knew there would be those who might attempt to rob his tomb, and so each room was also well stocked with Golems, or Animated objects that would attack any who entered.

Now, twenty years hence, the gilded priesthood guard the temple still, patrolling long corridors, tending to the complex locks, and serving as intermediaries between the voices that speak in hushed tones from within the central vault and the outside world.

<td> Beneath the ancient city of Bandar Pusat lies a vast network of tunnels, burial chambers and tombs. Hundreds of years ago, before the residents of this city began burning their dead, the officials of this already thousand-year-old metropolis were faced with the problem of overflowing cemeteries. They dug into and expanded the network of sewer tunnels already present, and created a vast subterranean network of passages and burial chambers that have since become home to monsters, secret societies, criminal organizations, and gods know what else. There are hidden entrances to Bandar Yang Mati in many buildings throughout the ancient city; few are aware of more than one, and nobody knows where they all are. And of course, the bones of tens of thousands of men, women and children are laid to rest here...</td>

However, the stake itself survived, deep under the roots of great tree. It has lay dormant for centuries, siphoning trace amounts of life from the foliage above. The world above remains unaware of the fearful goal of the Seed of Gulthias: the creation of a powerful undead, born of with the stake as its heart; perhaps even the rebirth of Gulthias himself. The cavern is a maddening maze of twisted roots and tunnels, stalked by blights and the undead corpses of a millennium's worth of unlucky adventuring parties.</td>

In order to study his topic of interest, Orvizar established his magic workshop in what was, to him, the most logical location for such an endeavor: A demiplane connected to the Far Realm. Surprisingly, Orvizar is said to have made a great discovery before the abnormal magical activity attracted the attention of one of the denizens of the plane. The entity subsumed the plane, absorbing it such that the workshop itself is inseparable from the creature. Orvizar's notes are presumably intact somewhere in the plane; his lost discovery might have the power to save the world from a great threat or, in the wrong hands, plunge it into madness.</td>

<td>The Vault of Tested Faith</td>
<td>Basement Repository for Unholy Things</td>
<td> For many decades, the ancient monastic order of the Crusading Spirit sent its new recruits to Erhaben's Mount, to be schooled at the temple of the same name. Over the years, the order's sorties recovered many artefacts deemed 'unholy'; the majority of these were destroyed. Of those that weren't, some were brought to the school for use as academic study, and eventually the collection of these built up in the vaults beneath the temple until they reached a critical mass. Unperturbed, the monks devised a new use for the vaults. Young boys' minds were always prone to wandering, straying into thoughts not proper for one being shaped into a noble crusader. The order instituted a new test, a way to reaffirm in the minds of their pupils what the real cost of straying from the true path would be. Deviants were sent in to the vaults, and left to find a route through. Such were the unholy terrors that had accumulated in those depths, many of the boys were overcome and joined the ranks of the undead things - or worse - that prowled in the darkness. But those who came through were reaffirmed in their faith, and often grew to become some of the most bold leaders of that great order. Of course, unholy power of that magnitude could not be contained forever, not with such regular feeding. In time, the contents of the basement overflowed, the temple reduced to an empty and desolate shell. But it still stands today; no-one dares to scrounge the masonry from its walls, and only the most foolhardy would dare to enter the vaults themselves...</td>

When inside, there are several large chambers with small amounts of treasure, maps, keys, scrolls, or carvings indicating that there is a large trove of desirable treasure in the deepest chamber. The deepest chamber contains much treasure, but the most important thing is a beautiful jeweled dagger on a pedestal. When entering the chamber, one is immediately attracted to this dagger above all else. When one holds the dagger, one is suddenly overcome with an incredible desire to sacrifice oneself then and there to the Cave. When this occurs, the living stone shifts and consumes the corpse, then waits for its next victim. The other treasures within are from consumed adventurers, and if those who enter make the Cave impatient or are somehow satisfied with the little they find in the various antechambers, the Cave spawns ashen ghouls from the living stone who share consciousness with the Cave; so it is that the Cave of Wonders can feed passively or actively.</td>

The town wasn't destroyed and was instead domed in, trapped from the outside with people still alive within. Resources grew limited, and everyone died within the first few months as the town was ignored by neighbors just over the mountains. Everyone was happy once it had vanished. A recent expedition of the town had a hole blown through the rock barrier, yet none of the explorers have exited.

With each appearance of the Mausoleum, the only inhabitant is the previous wizard whose contemplation of lichdom it was drawn to, whether they decided to undergo the transformation or not. It is unclear whether it is the actual wizard/lich, or a magical simulacrum created by the eerie tomb, but this being is decidedly not aggressive. Instead, it offers a tale of it's own thoughts and experiences, almost as a counselor of sorts.

<td>Vault of Arjuna / Forge of the Gods</td>
<td>Water Based Dungeon</td>
<td> A vast cavern carved down to magma, the Forge of the Gods is where the mighty smith set to work for a thousand days and nights to craft the armaments of the Heavenly Host before they went to battle their cousins in a brutal civil war. On the last day, Arjuna realized that he could not be part of the slaughter. He created a lake above his forge and hid his creations in an extra-dimensional vault, one only reachable by turning the turbines which once powered his bellows. The only thing he said is "My treasures will only return when my forge is left in ruins, vanishing like tendrils of vapor in a hurricane." To open the vault, you must drain the lake into the forge. The steam turns the turbines, opening the vault.</td>

<td>Village / Armpit of the Kingdom</td>
<td> Blackberry Falls is a stinking pit of a village located in the swamps beneath the eponymous waterfall. The town has no non-humans, no government, and only a lecherous priest and Butch the local thug to impose order. Everything stinks, everything sucks, and everyone is racist, xenophobic, or the doddering old buffoon who runs "Crispy Critters: Frog on a Stick!" Blackberry Falls, mistakenly presumed to be an idyllic riverfront paradise, is chosen as the site of upcoming peace talks. The players have been tasked with ensuring the town is up to the task.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Witch Hunt</td>
<td>Trap/Torture maze</td>
<td> As the adventurers walk through a forest they encounter twin brothers, one with a pitchfork and the other with a torch and shortsword. Upon questioning, the two brothers proclaim with naive gusto that they are on a “witch hunt”. The brothers will explain that there are witches living in a cabin in the forest who have been abducting members of their village and they intend to put a stop to it once and for all, inviting the party members to join them on their hunt. If the party does not accept the invitation, the brothers will continue on their way peacefully. If the party accepts the invitation, the brothers will lead them down the path to the witch cabin. They will crouch at the edge of the woods to observe the cabin, whispering tales of the witches’ kidnappings and evil deeds to the party. After a short time observing the cabin, the brothers will state that the witches must be out and that it would be best to wait inside and ambush them upon returning. The brothers will lead the party into the house, suspiciously looking around at the insides. If the PCs perform a search of the cabin, they can easily find a trap door which leads to the basement. The brothers will otherwise find the trap door and suggest that they go into the basement to wait for the witches so that they aren’t seen through the windows, and they will lead the way down. Once the entire party has entered the basement, the brothers will look around suspiciously, waving their torch. They turn toward the party and smile as their disguises melt away and they reveal themselves as the witches and they will be hunting the party. The basement goes dark, leaving the party to illuminate their own way and two cackling female voices will echo through the labyrinthine dungeon/basement. “We’re on a witch hunt… a witch hunt.” “A witch hunt a witch hunt...” “Run run run run...” as the witches run away from the party before combat begins. The dungeon will be played by the board game “Labrynth” with the PCs arranged in the center of the board and the witches dispersed. The witch monsters can each use their action to shift the rows and columns of the dungeon by placing a single random square. This ability has a three round cooldown (the dungeon can only reform once every three rounds). After the witches are defeated, the walls crumble away, leaving a grid of columns underneath the house with the illuminated ladder in the center of the game board. Monsters: 2 Hags</td>

There is enough space in the room to fight and remember, he's too big to get past the door!</td>

<td>Vault of the Planes</td>

<td> Long ago a wizard was tasked with guarding a small trove of powerful items, and to only give them to those who prove worthy. He built an small pocket dimension as a vault with a long-forgotten entrance. When the adventurers discover the place he is willing to part with some of the treasures. However, in addition to the group proving themselves worthy, he requires entertainment of some kind, because he bound his soul to the vault shortly before death and has been bored ever since.</td>

She passed away, but - filled with rage - returned from the dead and killed the necromancer and his henchmen. Legend says they're still down there, shambling through the halls.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Scorched Rock Temple</td>
<td>Temple of Cultist of Fire</td>
<td> Deep inside Fires of Life (Volcanic Mountain), lies a sprawling temple dedicated to a long forgotten deity of fire. First to bring civilization to the humanoid populations, these previous miners, settlers, and blacksmiths had uncovered a terrible secret. Bonding with the elemental plane of fire, they slowly became more industrious. Over a period of many years, they slowed the amount of trade coming out of the mountain. Not long after, no one who went to see what became of the settlers came back. Inside is a sprawling city, devoted to the worship of fire. A crucible at the heart of the city feeds the forges, where they create not weapons of steel, or iron, but weapons of fire. Flame elementals roam the city streets, the people themselves are devoid of hair, many more have harvested the power of fire into powerful magic. Broken into quarters this city houses 6,000 fiery souls, and untold elementals. The crucible at the center of the magma chamber is used for worship 4 times a day. As they mine deeper into the mountain, seeking to create a physical connection to the elemental plane of fire. This is displacing typical cavernous creatures. Umberhulks, goblins, kobolds, druegar, dwarves, and illithid. Leading to multiple factions, and multiple nooks and crannies to fill with all sorts of motivations.</td>

<td>Troll Cave and under complex</td>
<td>Small cave system, where the rear has collapsed into a ancient Stone Giant Prison</td>
<td> Eons ago during the time of Giants, before their empires were destroyed by the coming of dragons, Stone Giants of the land created many wonders. This prison was one of them. Carved deep underground, it was made to hold some of the worst enemies of their Empire, and even darker forces. Ages past, and giants were scattered to the winds, their kingdoms gone, their cities charred rubble. The prison remained, forgotten underground. Many prisoners were left to starve in their cells. Some, bound by ancient and powerful magic live on, suspended in time by their heavy stone manacles. In the deepest levels a red glow can be seen, and mad roaring heard. Great and powerful demons were caught and bound here, to be shackled eternally.</td>

<td>Temple of the Silver Blades</td>
<td>Temple Ruins, Shadow/Plant theme</td>
<td> The Silent Vales are governed by a druidic council of Elves, Lizardfolk and Men, but half a millennia ago they were entirely under the dominion of the Council of Thorns. An elite order of spies and killers enforced their will, eliminating trespassers and silently removing threats to elven sovereignity. A spate of recent murders among high-ranking druids and shamans has the council on edge- something is stalking the leylines between sacred sites, emerging in their inner sanctums to dispatch its victims quickly and quietly. Rumor has it the Silver Blades were capable of travelling in such a manner, but the order was destroyed centuries ago, their temple crumbling and overgrown, predatory plants and feral beasts lurking in the ruins. None remain that possess the skills and knowledge of the Silver Blades... right?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The House of Light</td>
<td>Cliffside Monastery, Light/Wind theme</td>
<td> For the first time in years, the orcish tribes in the western badlands have sent emissaries to the border, suing for peace. The only problem is, the colonial authorities have no idea what they're talking about- the border has seen very little conflict for over a decade now, and neither side has been keen to start anything. Rumors trickle in, though, of pilgrims and devotees of Pelor flocking to a once-abandoned temple on the edge of orcish lands, of a holy army of spirits led by a resurrected paladin, and of something rocketing through the skies, sundering tribal camps with rays of searing light. Who is this knight, and why are they trying to restart a vicious campaign that ended centuries ago?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Emberhold Awakened</td>
<td>Dwarven forge-complex, Machines & Magma theme</td>
<td> The Embershard clan has been nursing a bitter grudge ever since their clan was exiled from the hold generations ago. Successful mercenaries and northern traders, their clan lord has recently mobilised a large number of clansmen and machinery. They travel by longship to the north, along the coast of the Worldspine mountains, in a bid to reclaim an ancient forge-complex built and operated by their forefathers. The complex is accessed through a fjord leading into the heart of Goliath territory- and worse, the entrance sits at the base of the Skyshard, the tallest mountain on the continent and the stone-skins most sacred holy site. The peace between native Goliath and colonial dwarves can be fragile at times, but the Embershards' actions may provoke a full-blown war unless the party stops them from reawakening the forge, and the fury of the arcane war machines that lay dormant within.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Hyperborean Orrery</td>
<td>Frozen-over Mage's Research Facility, Ice/Magic theme</td>
<td> The last of the four heroes, the Archmage travelled far to the north to establish a research facility, from which she conducted magical experiments and educated those talented enough to reach her. The complex sits on a small island in the middle of a frozen lake, an expanse of ice that stretches for miles in every direction. After almost a century, however, communications stopped coming from the Orrery, and the pass that led to it was rendered inaccessible thanks to weather, landslides and a tribe of Goliath taking up residence. For those fool enough to travel the distance and brave the elements, there may be riches and knowledge beyond imagining. But the facility, half-buried in snow, crumbling walls exposed to the howling blizzards, is dangerous in itself. Traps, enchantments and magical constructs still defend the corpse-littered halls, and lost experiments may lurk in the wings, seething with madness and hatred. Worse, something pulses with arcane power and malevolent intelligence at the bottom of the facility, a chamber suspended within the depths of the frigid lake...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Solipzoa</td>
<td>Gargantuan space creature</td>
<td> A creature that clasps onto buildings and planets, slowly driving the inhabitants insane. It can be controlled by the master who is able to command it psionically while residing in it's stomach. It keeps parasites inside it's body to get rid of the intruders it can see or taste within it's body. One way to keep intruders out is a sphincter full of teeth and eyes. One eye has a sensitive nerve that, when closed, will open the sphincter.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Bifurcated Forks of Mentat</td>
<td>Extradimensional Maze</td>
<td> Mentat was a Psionicist and Diviner of great skill. He constructed this structure as a means to explore the possibilities of his past choices and those yet to come. His enemies took advantage of his meditative state while there and slew him unleashing the bound energies he was manipulating. Now the temple is an inhospitable place of strange angles, doors that lead to places they cannot, and rooms that should be impossible. It is said that anyone foolish enough to enter will face every mistake they've ever made come to life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tijd's Laboratory</td>
<td>Magical Laboratory</td>
<td> This is Tijd's Laboratory, constructed in a customised pocket dimension by Tijd himself, where he could do experiments on time-based magic in peace. The building is a 3 by 3 square of rooms, but in each room are two orbs that, when touched, transport you either into the far future or the far past of that room. The entry/exit is in the middle room of the 'present' slice. Tijd himself appears, frozen in some kind of magical crystal, in this room -- and the orb that takes you to this room's past is missing! This dungeon is one giant puzzle (with many potentially dangerous magical effects), as players have to find a way to get back to the past of the middle room, where Tijd is (presumably) about to accidentally seal himself in stasis, and rescue him!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dudek's Tower</td>
<td>Abandoned Tower/Glacier</td>
<td> This is an abandoned watchtower in the mountain passes that has slowly been buried by snow and ice -- it lies, half-leaning, half-toppled, back upon a steep slope of ice and rock. To scale the tower, you must pick your way both through ruined and crumpled rooms, and through caves and tunnels in the tumble of icy boulders behind. At the top lives a young white dragon, whose hoard includes a cursed sword...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grey Murk</td>
<td>Evil Swamp</td>
<td> This wetland lies near the old abandoned castle of the Grey family. Stories are still told of the gruesome murder of the Lord's family, and his descent into madness afterwards. Now a sinister presence fills the air here, and dancing lights through the mossy trees lure unlucky travellers to their dooms. Those who lose their way and die in this place rise up not long after as an undead. In the centre is a sunken crypt. Who is buried there?</td>
